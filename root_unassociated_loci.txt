67:AT1G02580	mea-1	Heterozygous  embryos abort if the mutant allele is  derived from the female, but develop  normally if it is derived from the male. Embryos derived  from mutant eggs abort irrespective of the  paternal contribution. Thus, the mea  mutant displays maternal-effect embryo lethality.
70:AT1G02580	mea-1	In the homozygous progeny:  During early stages of embryogenesis the  development of mea-1 embryos is indistinguishable  from wild-type siblings in cleared  or sectioned specimens. Visible differences  between wild-type and mea-1 embryos  began at the late globular stage. Globular mea-1 embryos show excess  cell proliferation and enlarge radially  symmetrical. When wild-type embryos  reach the mid to late heart stage, sibling  mea-1 embryos are still globular and contain  small vacuolated cells with curvilinear cell  walls and sometimes irregular cell divisions  in the ground tissue and procambium. Suspensor  and hypophysis are normal, and cotyledons  initiate synchronously as in the  wild type. Thus, despite increased cell proliferation  and occasional irregular cytokinesis,  morphogenetic progression is normal.  However, each stage is prolonged and includes  more division cycles, and morphogenesis  is delayed. As a consequence, giant  heart stage mea-1 embryos  are present along with late torpedo or cotyledonary  stage wild-type embryos. mea-1  heart stage embryos have supernumerary  cell layers. When wild-type siblings are  fully differentiated, most mea-1 embryos  have reached the late heart stage and are up  to 10 times larger than normal. mea embryos  degenerate during desiccation. These results  suggest that mea controls cell proliferation  during embryogenesis, allowing morphogenesis  to progress normally, albeit  slowly.  Endosperm development in mea-1 seeds  is indistinguishable from that of the wild  type at early stages. When cellularization  begins normally in wild-type seeds at the  transition from the globular to the heart  stage, no cellularization is observed in sibling  mea-1 seeds. Although nuclear divisions  take place more slowly in mea-1 endosperm,  the distribution of endosperm nuclei  is as in the wild type. Partial cellularization  occurs at the micropyle when mea-1  embryos reach the late heart stage in desiccating  seeds, but because fewer nuclei have  been generated, most of the centra	9545225

78:AT1G02860	nla	In contrast to wild type, anthocyanin accumulation did not occur in the senescing mutant rosette leaves.	17355433
79:AT1G02860	nla	Mutants failed to adapt to the conditions of nitrogen limitation and started senescence much earlier and more rapidly than did wild-type plants supplied with 3 mM nitrate: mutant plants supplied with 10 mM nitrate had a similar pattern of growth and development to wild type. When the nitrate concentration was reduced to 3 mM, the mutant plants started senescence in the fifth rosette leaf at 24 DAG, and after this point senescence progressed rapidly with all rosette leaves showing senescence symptoms at 26 DAG, and the whole rosette dying at 32 DAG. In contrast, wild-type plants displayed no senescence symptoms in the fifth rosette leaf until 32 DAG. In wild-type plants, the process of senescence proceeded slowly and gradually from the fifth to the youngest rosette leaves, and it took at least 2 weeks for all rosette leaves to show the senescence symptoms.	17355433
80:AT1G02860	nla	The cauline leaves in the mutant plants started senescence at 28 DAG, at least 10 days earlier than those in the wild-type plants. Further, the developing mutant siliques initiated senescence in their tips at 32 DAG, while the wild-type siliques showed no senescence symptoms  throughout their development but accumulated abundant anthocyanin which was not observed in the mutant siliques.	17355433
81:AT1G02860	nla	The early senescence process was arrested when nitrate was added after depletion.	17355433
82:AT1G02860	nla	The occurrence (at 24 DAG) and progression (at 28 DAG) of senescence in mutant rosette leaves were not accompanied by a significant reduction in the amounts of nitrogen-containing compounds: nitrate, total amino acids, soluble proteins, and total nitrogen. By contrast, they were largely reduced in the wild-type plants.	17355433
83:AT1G02860	nla	With the reduction of the nitrate concentration to 1 mM, the occurrence of the senescence phenotype in the rosette leaves of mutant plants was accelerated to 20 DAG, and severe senescence in the developing mutant siliques resulted in their death around 30 DAG without producing viable seeds. Under the same growth condition (1 mM nitrate), wild-type plants did not start senescence in their rosette leaves until 26 DAG, and produced fecund siliques.	17355433
84:AT1G02880	AtTPK1-KO	The AtTPK1-KO single mutant does not have any obvious aberrant phenotypes, but, the AtTPK1-KO /AtTPK2-KO double mutant demonstrates that these enzymes are required to produce thiamine pyrophosphate from thiamine.	17611796
85:AT1G02880	AtTPK1/2-KO	These double knock-out mutants are thiamine auxotrophs that have a seedling lethal phenotype unless they are supplied with exogenous thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) through a spray-based application.

88:AT1G02910	lpa1	The relative amounts of the PSII core subunits CP47, CP43, D1, and D2 is greatly reduced in the mutant, especially the PSII dimer.	16531500
89:AT1G02910	lpa1	Wild-type chloroplasts are larger than those of the mutant and have a larger number of discs per grana stack on average. In addition, the wild-type chloroplasts display well-developed membrane systems composed of grana connected by the stroma lamellae, but the thylakoid membrane systems in mutant chloroplasts are disturbed, and the membrane spacing is not as clear.	16531500

97:AT1G03160	SALK_033745	The leaves were visibly pale, and flowering was delayed by 5-7 days compared with the wild type plants. Mature mesophyll cells in mutant leaves contained fewer, larger chloroplasts than in wild type, and these were heterogeneous in size. This phenotype was more pronounced in older than in younger leaves. Mesophyll cell chloroplasts in wild type and mutant plants also differed ultrastructurally. In mutants, grana lamellae were less uniform in length and stacked in a staggered fashion, giving rise to a disorganized thylakoid array. Stroma thylakoids appeared less abundant than in wild type chloroplasts. In contrast, stroma thylakoids in mutants were similar in length to those in wild type but constituted a smaller proportion of the total thylakoid network.	16617119

167:AT1G04870	SALK_047046c	This mutant has delayed flowering compared to wild type plants when grown under long day conditions. Analysis of growth under short day conditions indicates that these mutants are not disrupted in the photoperiod pathway. They also seem to be able to respond to vernalization signals and to gibberellin. But they have an impaired autonomous pathway to flowering. FLC transcripts are up-regulated and SOC1 transcripts are down-regulated in these mutants through an unknown mechanism. There are no discernible changes in several types of histone modifications examined at the FLC locus in this mutant background nor are there changes in transcript levels for several autonomous pathway genes.

These seedlings did not segregate at the expected 1/16 ratio. Instead, we identified three double mutant seedlings in 176 F2 plants, suggesting the homozygous double mutants are arrested during embryogenesis.

546:AT1G18450	arp4	arp4-1 mutation causes partial sterility. Homozygous mutants had poorly developed siliques with a few or no seeds, compared with heterozygous mutant or wild type siliques that were fully filled with seeds. Flowers on the homozygous sterile plants were often slightly smaller and open for considerably longer periods than wild type, and a majority of them (80 to 90%) remained unfertilized. Otherwise, mutant plants revealed only mild very morphological and developmental phenotypes. The anthers from the sterile plants were often smaller, more heart shaped, and contained fewer pollen grains compared with wild type anthers, which were somewhat oblong and fully filled with pollen In addition, the mutant pollen grains were slightly larger than wild type. Because the mutant stamens often had shorter filaments than the wild type self-pollination was seldom efficient. However, upon manual pollination, pollen from the homozygous mutant plants germinated on self or wild type stigmas and produced fertile seeds, indicating that the mutant pollen grains, although larger, were viable. When homozygous mutant plant was pollinated with wild type pollen, the cross-pollination resulted in near normal development of siliques and production of seeds suggesting that the female development was not affected by the arp4-1 mutation. Sterility in the homozygous mutant plants is the result of production of fewer pollen and inefficient self-pollination. Mutant plants had a 35 to 40% reduction in the amount of AtARP4 protein compared with wild type.	15743449

1022:AT1G34210	serk1-1 serk2-1	double mutants were not able to produce seeds because of a lack of pollen  development in mutant anthers. In young buds, double mutant anthers developed normally, but serk1 serk2 microsporangia  produced more sporogenous cells that were unable to develop beyond meiosis. Furthermore, serk1 serk2 double mutants  developed only three cell layers surrounding the sporogenous cell mass, whereas wild-type anthers developed four cell layers.  Further confocal microscopic and molecular analyses showed that serk1 serk2 double mutant anthers lack development  of the tapetal cell layer, which accounts for the microspore abortion and male sterility.	16284306

1062:AT1G43710	atsdc-1	Under long day conditions, the size of atsdc-1 seedlings was much smaller than that of the wild type and the mutant never reached the height of the mature wild type. Mutant was sterile and had multiple inflorescences.

They accumulate pre-rRNA transcripts that have not been spliced at the A0 site.	17369435
1127:AT1G49430	lacs1-1 lacs2-3	The lacs1-1 lacs2-3 double mutants had a synergistic phenotype, compared to either of the single mutants, with drastically reduced stem wax and cutin contents, increased cuticle permeability, and severe male sterile in low humidity.	19392700
1128:AT1G49430	lacs2-1	Mutant leaves were small and irregular in shape compared with the wild type. Both surfaces of mutant leaves differed from the wild type. Adaxial surfaces of the wild type showed the characteristic jigsaw puzzle shape of pavement cells. In the mutant, the cells contained fewer, larger lobes. Epidermal cells on the abaxial surface of mutants were collapsed. This collapsed appearance was consistently seen in views of the abaxial leaf surface of mutant plants but was never observed on the abaxial surface of wild-type leaves or on the adaxial surfaces of either the wild-type or mutant plants.	14973169
1129:AT1G49430	lacs2-1	Mutant rosettes were slower to flower than wildtype plants (34.1 d versus 30.2 d under a 16-h photoperiod). Mutant plants produced smaller bolts, but flower morphology and fertility were normal, and siliques were similar in size to those on wild-type plants. The smaller bolts of the mutant yielded only 62 mg seed/plant compared with 177 mg seed/plant from wild-type controls. Harvested mutant seeds appeared smaller and darker than seeds from wild-type plants that had been grown alongside the mutants. Examination by light microscopy revealed that 50% of mutant seeds contained green embryos that could be distinguished through the testa. When the green and normal brown seeds from a mutant plant were germinated separately, the green seeds showed 79% germination compared with 100% germination for the brown seeds.	14973169
1130:AT1G49430	lacs2-1	Only 80.0% of mutant seedlings emerged. At 6 d, a percentage of the emerged mutant seedlings would not grow and develop into viable plants. These seedlings had white cotyledons, and they eventually died. At 19 d, 91.0% of the wild-type seeds that germinated had produced viable rosettes with four to five pairs of true leaves. For the mutants, only 72.2% of seeds that had germinated (58% of those sown) produced rosettes. At this stage, the mutant had only two to three pairs of true leaves.	14973169

1132:AT1G49430	lacs2-1	The cutin layer on the adaxial surface of mutant leaves was not significantly different in cross-sectional thickness from that of control wild-type leaves. However, the abaxial cutin layer on mutant leaves was substantially thinner than the wild type.	14973169
1133:AT1G49430	lacs2-1	The rate of chlorophyll leaching from mutant plants was threefold higher than the rate from wild-type controls.	14973169

1135:AT1G49430	lacs2-2	Strongly resistant to infection with Botrytis cinerea strain: infection sites on mutant leaves remained usually symptom free, in contrast to those on Col leaves.	17396154
1136:AT1G49430	lacs2-3	A number of ester-bound monomers were reduced in the mutant.	17396154
1137:AT1G49430	lacs2-3	Increased resistance to Botrytis infection: the visual phenotypes of the leaves 3 days after inoculation show that the lesions larger than the original infection site represent only 5% of lesions compared to 75% in WT plants.	17396154
1138:AT1G49430	lacs2-3	Similar phenotype to that described for lacs2-2.	17396154
1139:AT1G49430	lacs2-3	The distinct osmium-dense cuticular membrane  representing insoluble lipid-derived polymers such as cutin, visible at the epidermal outer extracellular matrix of WT plants, could not be seen at the leaf epidermis of the mutant. The remaining outer epidermal extracellular matrix sometimes had a distinct laminated structure.	17396154
1140:AT1G49430	lacs2-3	The mutant showed severe damage at a lower concentration of BASTA compared with WT Col-0 plants.	17396154
1141:AT1G49430	lacs2-3	The rate of water loss from the mutant is significantly higher than that of Col-0 plants.	17396154
1142:AT1G49430	lacs2-3	The total amount of omega-hydroxylated fatty acids and their derivatives was reduced 4- to 5-fold in the mutant compared with Col-0. The impact of mutation on the amount of dicarboxylic acids, characteristic of Arabidopsis cutin, was particularly strong, and the amount was reduced to 15-20% of WT amount.	17396154
1143:AT1G49820	mtk/eto3	etiolated seedlings of both wild type and mtk mutants have very low emission of ethylene. The eto3 mutant on the other hand has much higher emission of ethylene. The mtk/eto3 double mutant has a intermediate level of ethylene emission. Since mtk is involved in methionine recycle, the double mutant phenotype indicated that methionine recycle is required to sustain high rates of ethylene synthesis.	17144895

1148:AT1G50240	tio-1	Mutant plants had binucleate mature pollen grains, contrary to tricellular pollen in the wild type, due to failure to undergo cytokinesis at pollen mitosis. Binucleate mutant pollen contained two free nuclei and remained uncellularized. Mature mutant embryo sacs showed various numbers (2 to 5) of nuclei located toward the micropylar pole without visible cellular boundaries. After fertilization, mutant embryo sacs did not develop further and remained uncellularized. At early bicellular pollen stage, approximately 1/3 of dividing microspores had incomplete callose walls, which were correctly positioned at the generative cell pole but do not persist and are degraded before mid-bicellular pollen stage. Subsequently, at mid-bicellular pollen stage, when the generative cell nucleus is highly condensed in wild-type, in approximately 1/3 of mutant pollen, the smaller generative pole nucleus remains round and relatively uncondensed and does not divide further.	16332535

1271:AT1G55350	dek1-2	Severity of the phenotype varied between individual mutant seed. In the most severely affected seed, no embryo development could be detected. In such seeds the endosperm develops and cellularizes but fails to differentiate a complete peripheral (aleurone-like) surface layer. In less severe mutant seed, embryos develop to the globular stage before developmental arrest. In these embryos the plane of cell division is frequently uncontrolled compared to wild-type, the embryo proper is irregular, lacking a well defined L1 cell layer. In mutant seed developing an embryo, the endosperm completes the cellularization process and differentiates an aleurone- like layer in the micropylar chamber around the embryo, but this differentiation frequently stops towards the central chamber Wild-type development occurs in about 75% of seeds of the siliques from which mutant seeds were harvested.	15647902

1344:AT1G62360	ath1-1/bum1-1	Double mutant enhances the SAM phenotype. 80% of double mutants show shoot termination after germination and production of the first two sets of leaves. Shoots regenerate at a low frequency.	19175771
1345:AT1G62360	stm-1 trn2-23010	30 from a total of 40 seedlings (75%) developed at least one leaf 8 days after germination and all double mutant progeny developed leaves by day 20. In 19 stm-1 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings, leaves initiated from the base of the cotyledons, which were always fused due to lack of early STM activity. In the remaining 21 double mutant progeny single leaves or side shoots arose laterally, from the outside of the fused base of the petioles instead of being initiated from the shoot apex and thus resembled stm-1 mutant side shoots which are initiated after a long delay.	17351828
1346:AT1G62360	stm-1 trn2-23010	The double mutant progeny does not develop flowers.	17351828

In contrast to combination with stm-1, leaves of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutants never initiated from outside the base of the cotyledon petioles but emerged internally to the cotyledons where the SAM normally resides in wild type.
1350:AT1G62360	stm-5 trn2-23010	The double mutant progeny does not develop flowers.	17351828
1351:AT1G62750	sco1	Chloroplast differentiation was severely impaired in cotyledons but not in true leaves during early seedling growth, giving rise to the seedlings with white cotyledons. In sco1 chloroplast biosynthesis is slowed down leading to a delayed greening in cotyledons. Seed germination was delayed too in both, dark-grown seeds and light exposed seeds. Adult mutant plants had flowering time delayed for a week, while plant senescence was not affected. Mutant plants had reduced fresh weight throughout the life cycle. Seed set was affected too; mutant plants had reached only 40% of amount of seeds produced by the wild type plants.	16525888

1414:AT1G64520	rpn12a-1 (Col)	The rpn12a-1 mutant has defects in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via the 26S proteasome, rendering it more sensitive to misfolded proteins that are degraded in a 26S-proteasome / Ub-dependent manner. However, it has increased levels of the 20S core particle of the proteasome, and exhibits reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress, presumably since oxidatively damaged proteins can be degraded in a 20S proteasome-dependent, but 26S proteasome /Ub-independent manner.	17971041

1530:AT1G68480	jag nub	Strong enhancement of defects in leaf, stamen and carpel development compared with jag single mutants.	16554365
1531:AT1G68480	jag-1	Leaves have a serrated edge.  Sepals and petals are narrower and shorter than wt.  Mutant sepals develop jagged tissue at the tip.  Anthers are reduced with an altered shape and produce less pollen than wt.	14973282
1532:AT1G68640	roxy1-2/pan	Double mutant displays pentamerous flowers typical of PAN mutants but also displays defects in later stages of petal development.	19218396
1533:AT1G68725	atagp19	Both the size and number of the epidermal cells were found to be decreased in the mutant. However, stomata cells appeared normal in terms of morphology and fraction of total epidermal cells.	17217456
1534:AT1G68725	atagp19	Leaves, stems and sepals were lighter green than WT plants throughout the life cycle. Pigment content analyses demonstrated that mutant rosette leaves contained less chlorophyll and anthocyanin compared to WT.
1537:AT1G68725	atagp19	Mutant had fewer rosette leaves compared to WT plants at the same age. Moreover, mutant rosette leaves were smaller and more round and had shorter petioles than WT.
1540:AT1G68725	atagp19	Mutant hypocotyls were 75% of the length of WT hypocotyls when grown under long-day conditions, which corresponded to a reduction in hypocotyl cell length but not cell number. However, hypocotyl length was not compromised when mutant seedlings were grown in the dark.	17217456
1541:AT1G68725	atagp19	The mutant had shorter, more slender  inflorescence stems with fewer auxillary branches and side bolts. Mutant produced fewer flowers than WT and had fewer and shorter siliques, fewer seeds per silique and a higher percentage of sterile siliques, resulting in less seed production. More than half of the mutant flowers were fertile, and although they were smaller than WT flowers, they opened normally and had normal arrangements and numbers of floral organs. Some sterile flowers were open, while others remained closed. One reason for sterility was the failure of the stamens to elongate beyond the pistil at floral stage 14, whereas, in WT, the stamens were longer than the pistil and brushed against the stigma to allow pollination and fertilization.	17217456
1542:AT1G68725	atagp19	Whereas, as plants matured, WT rosette leaves curled down, mutant leaves remained flat.	17217456
1544:AT1G68740	pho1;h1-1	T-DNA knock-out mutants of PHO1;H1 neither showed growth defects nor alteration in phosphate (Pi) transport dynamics, or Pi content, compared with wild type.	17461783
1545:AT1G68740	pho1;h1-2	Vegetative growth of the mutant appears to be comparable with wild type for plants grown in soil, although the mutant has flowers with smaller petals and reduced fertility.  The abnormal flower phenotype has been reported to occur in a fraction of the transgenic plants derived from the Madison collection, and is thought to be linked to the presence of an AP1 sequence in the T-DNA.	17461783
1546:AT1G68765	ida	Ethylene-sensitive mutant, floral organs remain attached to the plant body after the shedding of mature seeds, even though a floral abscission zone develops. No other developmental processes were affected. When grown on the medium containing ethylene (10 ppm), mutant seedlings response was limited to lack of abscission in senescenced floral organs. Except with regard to floral abscission, seedling response to ethylene was the same as in wild type.	12972671

1690:AT1G71830	serk1-1 serk2-1	double mutants were not able to produce seeds because of a lack of pollen  development in mutant anthers. In young buds, double mutant anthers developed normally, but serk1 serk2 microsporangia  produced more sporogenous cells that were unable to develop beyond meiosis. Furthermore, serk1 serk2 double mutants  developed only three cell layers surrounding the sporogenous cell mass, whereas wild-type anthers developed four cell layers.  Further confocal microscopic and molecular analyses showed that serk1 serk2 double mutant anthers lack development  of the tapetal cell layer, which accounts for the microspore abortion and male sterility.	16284306

1797:AT1G78290	snrk2.8-1	The activity of glyI in wild type and snrk2.8-1 knockout plants under control conditions and salt stress was tested. Salt treatment stimulated the activity of the enzyme in the wild type plant, but less stimulation was observed in the snrk2.8-1. glyI activity was lower after salt treatment in the snrk2.8-1, but salt stress still increased the protein activity.

1879:AT1G80760	SALK_046323C	Under conditions of low boron, nip6;1-2 mutants have smaller, darker green, and more irregularly shaped young rosette leaves than wild type plants. These leaves have smaller cells and lack intercellular air spaces. Lower boron levels accumulate in these young rosette leaves and in stems with shoot apicies when nip6;1-2 mutants are grown under low boron conditions, but, wild type levels of boron accumulate when these plants are grown with sufficient boron. Even under low boron conditions, there are no significant differences in boron levels between wild type and mutant plants in mature leaves. In addition, under normal boron conditions, the leaves of nip6;1-2 mutants grow normally and accumulate wild type levels of boron.	18952773

2086:AT2G02560	atcand1-1	Mutants resistant to sirtinol and auxin, but not to gibberellins or brassinolide. Displayed developmental phenotypes similar to those of axr1, namely, short petioles, downwardly curling leaves, short inflorescence, and reduced fertility.	15181201
2087:AT2G02560	cand1-1	Similar to cand1-2 and cand1-3 mutants. Rosette leaves of mutants plants were much smaller than those of wild-type plants and had a wavy morphology. Mutants flowered later than wild-type plants, with an increased number of rosette leaves indicating that the vegetative to reproductive growth transition of the primary shoot apical meristem was affected. The growth of axillary meristems is also abnormal, where a large number of smaller leaves are produced. Furthermore, the mutants have very low fertility, with less than one seed produced on average per silique. Mutant plants continued to make new flowers while wild-type plants of the same age started to senesce. Other notable phenotypes of cand1 mutants include dwarfism and loss of apical dominance. When examined closely, dwarfism largely results from reduced stem elongation. Mutant plants had a strong increase in the number of secondary inflorescences, an indication that they have lost apical dominance.	15208391
2088:AT2G02560	cand1-1	When grown in darkness, mutant seedlings exibited mild photomorphogenic phenotypes, with short hypocotyls and opened cotyledons.	15208391
2089:AT2G02560	hve-2	Cotyledon areoles (regions of the lamina completely bordered by veins) were often incompletely closed, while in the wild type, the cotyledons contained three or four complete areoles. The reduction in vein numbers was also apparent in the first two rosette leaves, which had fewer secondary veins than the wild type. No quaternary veins and only a few tertiary veins, which ended blindly within the areoles, were present in mutant leaves, the intramarginal vein of which was occasionally interrupted.	16943276
2090:AT2G02560	hve-3	Cotyledon areoles (regions of the lamina completely bordered by veins) were often incompletely closed, while in the wild type, the cotyledons contained three or four complete areoles. The reduction in vein numbers was also apparent in the first two rosette leaves, which had fewer secondary veins than the wild type. No quaternary veins and only a few tertiary veins, which ended blindly within the areoles, were present in mutant leaves, the intramarginal vein of which was occasionally interrupted.	16943276
2091:AT2G02560	hve-3	Similar to Atcand1-1 mutant. Resistant to sirtinol and auxin, but not to gibberellins or brassinolide. Displayed developmental phenotypes similar to those of axr1, namely, short petioles, downwardly curling leaves, shorter inflorescence. More severe inflorescence phenotype were found in this mutant compared to the atcand1-1 (ems-generated) mutation. Mutant plants were completely sterile.	16943276
2092:AT2G02760	ubc1-1 ubc2-1	The flowering of ubc1/2 double mutants is accelerated compared to wild type plants under long days and short days. Histone2B ubiquitination is lost in ubc1/2 mutants and FLC expression is repressed. There are gene-specific changes in the patterns of histone ubiquitination and methylation in this mutant.	18849490
2093:AT2G02760	ubc2-1	This mutant flowers at the same time as wild type plants, but, a ubc1 ubc2 double mutant has accelerated flowering.	18849490
2094:AT2G02810	CS100184	ER-derived vesicles obtained from atutr1 plants had a decreased uptake of UDP-glucose compared to the wild type. BiP and Calnexin are overexpressed in the mutant, suggesting that atutr1 plants have the unfolded protein response constitutively activated.	16467298
2095:AT2G02950	phyA-211 pks1-1	Under hourly R pulses, the pks mutation also had no effect in the phyA background.	14615593

2097:AT2G02950	pks1-1	In dark controls, hypocotyl growth was unaffected by the mutations and the cotyledons remained fully closed. Compared with those in the wild type, hypocotyl growth inhibition and  cotyledon unfolding responses to hourly FR pulses were significantly greater in the mutant.	14615593
2098:AT2G02950	pks1-1	No differences were observed under hourly R pulses or continuous FR between wild-type and mutant plants.	14615593

2101:AT2G02950	pks1-1 pks2-1	With respect to cotyledon unfolding and greening, the double mutant was  indistinguishable from the wild type.	14615593
2102:AT2G02950	pks1-101	Under FRc conditions, the length mutant hypocotyls is decreased compared to that of wild-type plants.  Under Rc conditions, the hypocotyl length is also decreased and the cotyledon area is larger.	16891401
2103:AT2G03120	spp-2	no homozygotes were recovered from the heterozygous mutant, mutant pollen appeared normal by Alexander stain but failed to germinate, the organization of the male germ unit (MGU) is disrupted, the vegetative nuclei were malformed with displacement of the two sperm cells, or the entire MGU were mislocalized to the pollen periphery.	19168645

2109:AT2G03680	spr1-5	Phenotype not described.	15084720
2111:AT2G03710	ap1 cal sep4	Flower meristems behave like inflorescence meristems and continuously elaborate new meristems, resulting in the 'cauliflower' phenotype. Eventually flowers resembling those of ap1 single mutants eventually appear and set seeds.	15530395
2112:AT2G03710	ap1 cal sep4	Inflorescences take 7-10 days longer than ap1 cal mutant to begin producing flowers.	15530395
2113:AT2G03710	ap1 sep4	Meristem defect intermediate between that of ap1 and ap1 cal mutants. Inflorescences appear caulifower-like early after bolting but soon start producing ap1-like flowers on their periphery.	15530395
2114:AT2G03710	sep1 sep2 se3/+ sep4	Early flower mutant phenotypes are lessened in later-arising flowers which appear more normal whilst still displaying significant perturbations of organ development.	15530395

2118:AT2G03710	sep1 sep2 se3/+ sep4	Stellate trichomes are frequently observed on carpels (never on wild-type).	15530395
2119:AT2G03710	sep1 sep2 sep3 sep4	All flower organs are converted to leaf-like organs, most strikingly on their adaxial surface. Abaxial epidermal cells are made up of a mixture of leaf- and sepal-like characteristics. Leaf characteristics include an abundance of branched trichomes.	15530395
2120:AT2G03710	sep1 sep2 sep4	Adaxial surface of first whorl organs are unaffected.	15530395
2121:AT2G03710	sep3 sep4	Adaxial surface of first whorl organs are unaffected.	15530395

2124:AT2G03800	gek1-1	Ethanol hypersensitivity.	15215505
2125:AT2G03800	gek1-1	When the mutant seedlings grown on normal medium were transferred to medium containing 0.03-0.1% (v/v) ethanol, their growth was reduced strongly.	15215505
2126:AT2G03800	gek1-2	Ethanol hypersensitivity.	15215505
2127:AT2G03800	gek1-2	The germination rates of the mutant were significantly reduced by 0.003% (v/v,~0.5 mM) ethanol, whereas the wild type germinated normally in the presence of at least 0.3% (v/v) ethanol.	15215505
2128:AT2G03800	gek1-2	The mutant died eventually in the presence of 0.1% ethanol.	15215505
2129:AT2G03800	gek1-2	When the mutant seedlings grown on normal medium were transferred to medium containing 0.03-0.1% (v/v) ethanol, their growth was reduced strongly.	15215505

2133:AT2G03800	gek1-3	When the mutant seedlings grown on normal medium were transferred to medium containing 0.03-0.1% (v/v) ethanol, their growth was reduced strongly.	15215505
2134:AT2G04240	xerico	Resistant to exogenous ABA. Seeds contained lower amounts of endogenous ABA than wildtype.	17933900
2135:AT2G04270	CS318713	Segregates 3:1 WT:hoomozygous mutant. Homozygotes are white and arrest after the cotyledon stage. The phenotype is rescued by growth on sucrose.	18515828
2136:AT2G04270	SALK_093546C	White seedlings that arrest at the cotyledon stage. Phenotype rescued by providing sucrose. On sucrose, mutant plants have small chloroplasts with fewer thylakoids and shorter granal stacks than WT. Fully developed chloroplasts are not observed.	18515828
2137:AT2G04550	SALK_039359c	A higher proportion of the MPK12 protein isolated from ibr5-3 mutants is dually phosphorylated. The MPK12 protein isolated from ibr5-3 mutants also has higher activity than the MPK12 protein isolated from wild type plants.	19000167
2138:AT2G05070	SALK_005614C	The mutant shows ABA insensitivity in stomatal movement, including promotion of stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening. The detached leaves of the mutant lose more water than those of the wild-type plants under dehydration condition; both young seedlings and mature plants of the mutant have lower capacity to conserve water during drought stress in comparison with wild-type plants. The ROS levels increase in the mutant in comparison with wild-type plants in both the whole leaves and in guard cells. Treatment with low concentrations of ABA reduces ROS levels in both whole leaves(1 to 10 uM ABA application) and in guard cells(5 uM ABA application) in the mutant plants.	22143917
2139:AT2G05210	pot1-1	No visible phenotype.	17627276
2140:AT2G05210	pot1-1	Telomeres in wild-type siblings appeared as a homogeneous smear of products ranging from 1.6 to 4.5 kb. Telomere tracts in pot1-1 were much shorter than in wild-type and showed a more discrete banding pattern.
2143:AT2G05210	pot1-1	The fate of telomeres in pot1 mutants was followed for several plant generations and it was found that telomere length in pot1-1 decreased progressively with each generation. The ever-shorter-telomere phenotype and sharp TRF banding profile were strikingly similar to the phenotype associated with tert mutants, which lose 200-500 bp of telomeric DNA per plant generation.	17627276
2144:AT2G05210	pot1-1 ku70	The mutants failed to elongate their telomeres, and exhibited a heterogeneous profile of TRF products similar to that seen in ku70 tert.	17627276
2145:AT2G05210	pot1-1 ku70 tert	Same degree of telomere shortening as in the pot1 ku70 and ku70 tert double mutants.	17627276
2146:AT2G05210	pot1-1 tert	Telomeres in the double mutants shortened at the same rate as in either single mutant.
2149:AT2G05210	pot1-1 tert	Telomeres of the same length and sharp banding profile were found in the double mutant, as in their tert and pot1-1 siblings.	17627276
2150:AT2G05210	pot1-2	No visible phenotype.	17627276
2151:AT2G05210	pot1-2	Telomeres in wild-type siblings appeared as a homogeneous smear of products ranging from 1.6 to 4.5 kb. Telomeres were significantly shorter in pot1-2 than in wild-type, or even pot1-1.
2154:AT2G06510	Atrpa1a / Atmlh3	This double mutant has a lower chiasma frequency than either single mutant, but more chiasma than Atrpa1a/Atmsh4 or Atmsh4.	19153602
2155:AT2G06510	Atrpa1a / Atmsh4	This double mutant has even lower fertility and shorter siliques than atrpa1 mutants. These mutants have a residual chiasmata frequency and distribution comparable to msh4 mutants.	19153602
2156:AT2G06510	GK-406D08 (HOMOZYGOUS)	Meiosis in pollen mother cells proceeds normally from early prophase I to the pachytene stage where full synapsis is observed, in the mutants. However, a reduced number of chiasmatas are detected in the mutants during chromosome condensation in late diplotene/diakinesis.Univalent chromosomes present at metaphase I cause mis-segregation at meiosis I and therefore, aneuploid tetrads are observed following meiosis II. There is no evidence of chromosome fragmentation in these mutants, suggesting that RPA1a is not required per se for the repair of double strand breaks during meiosis.	19153602
2157:AT2G06510	SALK_017580C	According to one report, this T-DNA insertion causes lethality and the authors could not recover homozygous mutants from a heterozygous parent.	15978034
2158:AT2G06510	SALK_017580C	The rpa1a mutant has normal vegetative growth, but lower levels of fertility. Siliques are shorter in rpa1a mutants than in wild type plants, and their mean seed set per silique is reduced by ~68%. Pollen viability is also reduced in the mutants. Meiosis in pollen mother cells proceeds normally from early prophase I to the pachytene stage where full synapsis is observed, in the mutants. However, a reduced number of chiasmatas are detected in the mutants during chromosome condensation in late diplotene/diakinesis.Univalent chromosomes present at metaphase I cause mis-segregation at meiosis I and therefore, aneuploid tetrads are observed following meiosis II. There is no evidence of chromosome fragmentation in these mutants, suggesting that RPA1a is not required per se for the repair of double strand breaks during meiosis. There are no major defects in axis formation or synaptonemal complex formation in these mutants, nor are the number of MSH4 foci altered. However, there is a reduced number of MLH1 and MLH3 foci, suggesting that more recombination intermediates are repaired as non-cross-overs	19153602
2159:AT2G06925	SALK_099415C	WT phenotype. Also, no effect on light-induced stomatal opening.	18725378
2160:AT2G11810	mgd2 mgd3	No visible or biochemically determinable mutant phenotype observed under nutrient-sufficient conditions.	18808455
2162:AT2G11810	mgd3-1	No visible or biochemically determinable mutant phenotype observed under nutrient-sufficient conditions.	18808455
2164:AT2G13560	nad-me1.1	The nad-me1.1 mutants appear to grow and develop normally and display normal photosynthetic behavior, however, the plants have a significant reduction in NAD-dependent malic enzyme activity.	18223148
2165:AT2G13560	nad-me1.1 / nad-me2.1	The nad-me1.1 / nad-me2.1 double mutant has no detectable NAD-dependent malic enzyme activity. However, it appears to grow and develop normally and to have normal photosynthetic parameters. However, the levels of several metabolites, including fructose, galactose, sucrose, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, citrate, and several amino acids are altered in these double mutants relative to wild type plants. The metabolites affected differ depending on whether the analyses are done at the end of the day or end of the night.	18223148
2166:AT2G13680	cals5-1	severely reduced silique length and seed yield	15842618
2167:AT2G13680	cals5-2	severely reduced silique length and seed yield	15842618
2168:AT2G14120	drp3a-1/drp3b-1	Plants are slower growing than single mutants or non-mutant siblings. Pale mutant color due to decreased number of mitochondria and peroxisomes.	18785999
2169:AT2G14540	SALK_088095	When exposed to MMS, mutants grew consistently  more vigorously than wild-type. Reduced induction of DNA repair- and cell cycle-related genes.
2172:AT2G14560	SALK_039201	Compromised in RPP4-mediated resistance.  Mutants allow increased growth of Hyaloperonospora parasitica hyphae frequently surrounded by a trail of necrotic plant cells.	18346188
2173:AT2G15290	cia5-1	Seedling lethal when grown on soil, but produced albino leaves or even inflorescent tissues on synthetic media supplemented with sucrose.	16891400
2174:AT2G15290	cia5-1	The youngest part of the homozygous progeny are slightly green at the center of the seedlings.	16891400

2178:AT2G15290	cia5-2 tic20-I	Albino phenotype even in the youngest part of the seedling, which often accumulates anthocyanins.	16891400
2179:AT2G15290	cia5-2 tic20-I	Seedlings grown in artificial media supplemented with sucrose are able to produce a few irregularly shaped leaves, followed by an arrest in growth. The timing of growth arrest varies from one seedling to the next leading to a variety of sizes and morphologies.	16891400
2180:AT2G15290	cia5-3	Cotyledons in young homozygous progeny were red, most likely because chlorophyll was low or absent, and anthocyanin pigments accumulated.	17337631
2181:AT2G15290	cia5-3	Dwarfed and chlorotic mutant plants.	17337631
2182:AT2G15290	cia5-3	In the mutant's homozygous progeny, mature rosette leaves were retarded in growth. Secondary and tertiary veins in mutant leaves were thicker than in the wild type, and their diameter was commensurate with that of the primary vein. The organization of leaf mesophyll into palisade and spongy parenchyma cells was lost, and the leaf surface was extremely curled. This deformation in the mutant leaf was already visible in  cotyledons. In addition, leaf cross sections revealed that mesophyll cells, in contrast with wild-type plants, do not contain fully differentiated chloroplasts.
2185:AT2G15290	cia5-3	Plastids of cotyledons, leaves, and shoot apices in the mutant plants were characterized by the presence of electron-dense phytoferritin aggregates. Those clusters were not found in any chloroplasts of wild-type plants.	17337631
2187:AT2G15290	cia5-3	Seedling lethal when grown on soil, but produced albino leaves or even inflorescent tissues on synthetic media supplemented with sucrose.	16891400
2188:AT2G15290	cia5-3	The majority of the slowly growing homozygous mutant progeny produced almost transparent rosette leaves; however, in approximately one-third of the plants, the leaves appeared white. This subpopulation of mutants was even smaller and did not produce inflorescences.	17337631
2189:AT2G15290	cia5-3	The shoot apex and the very young emerging  leaves of homozygous progeny were pale green and their leaves turned chlorotic while growing. After 6 weeks on sucrose-containing agar, surviving mutant plants were able to produce an inflorescence; again, the young sepals of the flower were pale green and became white subsequently.	17337631
2190:AT2G15290	cia5-3	The style and developing silique of the flower of the homozygous progeny were pale green, whereas leaves and stem accumulated anthocyanin pigments.	17337631
2191:AT2G15290	cia5-3	The youngest part of the homozygous progeny are slightly green at the center of the seedlings.	16891400
2192:AT2G15290	pic1-2	Cotyledons in young homozygous progeny were red, most likely because chlorophyll was low or absent, and anthocyanin pigments accumulated.	17337631

2195:AT2G15290	pic1-2	The majority of the slowly growing homozygous mutant progeny produced almost transparent rosette leaves; however, in approximately one-third of the plants, the leaves appeared white. This subpopulation of mutants was even smaller and did not produce inflorescences.	17337631
2196:AT2G15290	pic1-2	The shoot apex and the very young emerging  leaves of homozygous progeny were pale green and their leaves turned chlorotic while growing.

2197:AT2G15290	pic1-2	The style and developing silique of the flower of the homozygous progeny were pale green, whereas leaves and stem accumulated anthocyanin pigments.	17337631
2198:AT2G15290	pic1-3	No visible phenotype.	17337631
2199:AT2G15820	otp51-2	Homozygous otp51-2 mutants can only survive in sucrose-supplemented in vitro cultures under low light conditions. The small developmentally delayed mutants are pale yellow under normal light conditions. otp51-2 mutants fail to splice intron 2 of the the ycf3 transcript encoded in the chloroplast genome. Because YCF3 is required for the proper assembly of photosystem I (PSI), These mutants have multiple defects related to photosynthesis. They have lower levels of total protein, thylakoid membrane protein, and chlorophyll than wild-type plants when both are grown hydroponically. Chlorophyll a/b ratios are elevated in otp51-2 mutants, several PSI and PSII proteins cannot be detected, chlorophyll fluorescence patterns are altered, and the quantum efficiency of PSII is reduced. otp51-2 mutants also have elevated levels of unspliced products from the trnK, trnL, trnV, trnG, clpP, trnI, trnA, and atpF genes.	18557832

2203:AT2G17290	SALK_033392	ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells. Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles. However, rapid-type anion channel current activity was not affected, consistent with the partial stomatal closing response in double mutants via a proposed branched signaling network. Imposed Ca(2+) oscillation experiments revealed that Ca(2+)-reactive stomatal closure was reduced in CDPK double mutant plants. However, long-lasting Ca(2+)-programmed stomatal closure was not impaired.	17032064
2204:AT2G17290	SALK_093308	ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells. Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles. However, rapid-type anion channel current activity was not affected, consistent with the partial stomatal closing response in double mutants via a proposed branched signaling network. Imposed Ca(2+) oscillation experiments revealed that Ca(2+)-reactive stomatal closure was reduced in CDPK double mutant plants. However, long-lasting Ca(2+)-programmed stomatal closure was not impaired.	17032064
2205:AT2G17370	hmg2	The hmg2 mutant has about 15% lower sterol levels than wild type plants, but its sterol composition is normal. It also has about a 25% drop in triterpenoid levels compared to wild-type plants.	17917299
2206:AT2G17420	ntra ntrb	Double mutant plants are viable but the pollen has reduced fitness, and they showed slowed plant growth, modified seed shape, and high accumulation of anthocyanins. Seedlings are not hypersensitive to oxidant stresses	17586656

2212:AT2G17520	SALK_018112	bZIP60 mRNA splicing is detectable in ire1a-2 (SALK_018112), whereas it is completely abolished in ire1a-2 (SALK_018112)/ire1b-1 (GABI_638B07) double mutant.	
2213:AT2G17520	ire1a-2/ire1b-1	bZIP60 mRNA splicing is completely abolished in ire1a-2 (SALK_018112)/ire1b-1 (GABI_638B07) double mutant whereas it is still detectable in ire1a-2 and ire1b-1 single mutants. ire1a-2/ire1b-1 double mutant is much more sensitive to tunicamycin than wild-type and ire1a-2 and ire1b-1 single mutant plants.

2216:AT2G17950	trn2-23010 wus-1	Whereas carpels were completely absent in wus-1 flowers and only 1.6 stamens (compared to 6 in wild type) developed in the third floral whorl, all trn2-23010 wus-1 flowers developed 2 carpels, which in contrast to trn2-23010 single mutants were seldom open (33%) and more usually fused. Consistent with the increased number of stamens (4.2 on average) in the third floral whorl, the trn2 mutation may compensate for a premature consumption of stem cells in wus-1 flowers. In contrast, the number of sepals and petals in the outer perianth whorls in trn2-23010 wus-1 was closer in number to that of the trn2 mutant rather than to wus-1 single mutant flowers.

2490:AT2G27250	trn2-23010 clv3-2	trn2-23010 clv3-2 double mutant flowers also exhibited an additive phenotype not observed in single clv3-2 or trn2-23010 plants: double mutant flowers had reduced organ numbers in sepal, petal and stamen whorls, reminiscent of trn2-23010 single mutant flowers and in contrast to clv3-2 single mutant flowers, there was no increase in the number of stamens. However, in the fourth whorl, where trn2 loss-of-function interferes with the fusion of two carpels to the single style, double mutant flowers were comprised of multiple carpels, most of them fused (73%) as typically found in the clv3-2 mutation. Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers.

2511:AT2G28110	fra8	Dramatic reduction in fiber wall thickness of a vessel member cells, a decrease in stem strength, and alteration of the overall growth were observed in mutated plants. Comparative analyses of cell wall polysaccharide fractions from fra8 and wild-type stems showed that the xylan and cellulose contents are drastically reduced in fra8, whereas xyloglucan and pectin are elevated. Inflorescence stems were shorter in height, and rosette leaves smaller in size. Mild wilty phenotype was sometimes found in greenhouse conditions.	16272433

2528:AT2G29630	thiC	A severe reduction (~10-fold) of THIC levels in plants decreases vitamin B1 (thiamin diphosphate (TPP)) levels and also leads to changes in the levels of numerous other metabolites since so many primary metabolic enzymes require a TPP co-factor. For example, alanine, asparagine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and malate levels rise while fumarate, gentiobiose, and ribose  levels decrease. thiC mutants are chlorotic and arrest in their development at the cotyledon stage.The mutant phenotype can be largely rescued by continuous supplementation with thiamin.	18332905
2529:AT2G29630	thic1	thic1 mutants produce white leaves and die early unless they are grown with thiamine supplements. Total thiamine levels are reduced by roughly 60% in the thic1 mutant.	18332905

2548:AT2G30410	kis-T1	Compared with wild-type trichomes, which normally are three-branched, the mutant has trichomes that are either two-branched or unbranched. Trichome stems and trichome branches are reduced in length, and the tips often are blunted.	12215519
2549:AT2G30410	kis-T1	In leaf sections, mesophyll cells are frequently highly enlarged with one large nucleus. In some cases, the enlarged cells possesse incomplete cell walls and contain several nuclei.	12215519
2550:AT2G30410	kis-T1	Male and female sterile. Male and female meiosis and/or early stages of gametophytic development are impaired. On the male side, the tetrad containing the four meiotic products seem to be normal initially, but before the release of the four microspores, nuclei appear to be fragmented. This phenotype is not fully penetrant. Approximately 5% of the released microspores are arrested at the binucleate stage, and 3% are arrested at the trinucleate stage, whereas the remaining microspores  have collapsed. A few microspores germinate  and form a pollen tube within the anther.  On the female side, ovule development started normally. However, at floral stage 12, when meiosis is completed in the wild type (Schneitz, 1995) and embryo sac development  has proceeded to the binucleate stage, the mutants still lack an embryo sac.	12215519
2555:AT2G30410	kis-T1	Whereas, under normal light conditions, wild-type and mutant hypocotyls are similar in length. However, in the dark, hypocotyl elongation is much reduced in the mutants compared with the wild type.

2558:AT2G30580	drip1-1 drip 2-1	drip1-1 drip1-2 double mutants are developmentally delayed and bolt, flower, and set seed later than wild type plants. However, their overall size can exceed that of wild type plants if they receive adequate water. The transcript profile of these mutants differs from wild type under normal conditions, and in response to dehydration stress. Levels of numerous stress-inducible transcripts are increased in the double mutant. In addition, the double mutants appear to be more tolerant to dehydration stress than wild type plants, based on ion leakage assays and recovery after dehydration stress experiments.	18552202
2559:AT2G30580	drip2-1	There are no obvious morphological defects in the drip2-1 mutant, but the drip1-1 drip 2-1 double mutant has altered gene expression levels and dehydration tolerance.	18552202

Occasionally, inflorescences of the double mutant failed to produce any normal flower buds, resulting in pin-like structures that were not found in either stv1 or ett single mutants. Pin-like inflorescences are formed in mp, pid, and pin1 mutants and in wild-type plants treated with polar auxin transport inhibitors.	16227452

A number of double mutant gynoecia were nearly completely valveless, and in those, ovules grew on top of a placental surface. In addition, the apical ends of sty1-1 ett-1 gynoecia were less fused than those of ett-1 and sty1-1, and ovules frequently protruded at the apex. The amount of stylar and stigmatic tissues was reduced compared with ett-1, and the double mutant was sterile.

2870:AT2G39940	coi1-1 (GL1)	coi1-1 (GL1) single mutant was generated by backcrossing the original coi1-1 to Col-0. coi1-1 single mutant leaves produce fewer trichomes than wild-type (ca. 30% reduction). Morphology and branching number of coi1-1 trichomes are normal. coi1-1 does not increase trichome density in response to wounding or methyl jasmonate treatment.	19234066
2872:AT2G39940	coi1-16	Erysiphe cichoracearum spores had germinated by day 1, but conidiophores did not develop until 4 days post infection. After 6 dpi, many individual colonies had merged; therefore, further analysis was unfeasible. The numbers of conidiophores in colonies on coi1-16 plants increased faster than on wild-type plants.	12437300
2873:AT2G39940	coi1-16	Following <i>Pythium irregulare</i> infection, salicylic acid levels increased over wild-type levels.	17513501
2874:AT2G39940	coi1-16	Following <i>Pythium irregulare</i> infection, the increase in JA levels was lower in sid2-1 plants than in wild type.	17513501
2875:AT2G39940	coi1-16	This mutant has responses to JA similar to coi1-1, except that it displays temperature-sensitive fertility and can be maintained as a pure breeding line.	12437300
2877:AT2G39940	coi1-20	Coronatine, which effectively inhibits ABA-induced stomatal closure, cannot prevent it in the mutant, nor can it efficiently reopen its stomata.	16959575

2884:AT2G40100	SALK_032779C	The mutant shows ABA insensitivity in stomatal movement, including promotion of stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening. The detached leaves of the mutant lose more water than those of the wild-type plants under dehydration condition; both young seedlings and mature plants of the mutant have lower capacity to conserve water during drought stress in comparison with wild-type plants. The ROS levels increase in the mutant in comparison with wild-type plants in both the whole leaves and in guard cells. Treatment with low concentrations of ABA reduces ROS levels in both whole leaves(1 to 10 uM ABA application) and in guard cells(5 uM ABA application) in the mutant plants.	22143917

2906:AT2G40840	dpe2-6	Grows more slowly than wild type, has high starch content at the end of the night and has very high levels of maltose.	14996213
2907:AT2G40850	SALK_022689	Anthers of plants homozygous for a T-DNA insertion in At2g40850 contained only a small number of pollen grains, and consequently, few seeds were produced per plant. Microscopic examination of the mutant anthers revealed that meiosis, the earliest step of pollen formation, was not affected. However, after tetrads had formed, the cells of the tapetum showed abnormally enlarged vacuoles. Later in development, pollen grains exhibited irregular shapes and, in mature anthers, most of them had collapsed.	17905860
2911:AT2G40890	ref8	Reduced fluorescent phenylpropanoid secondary metabolites, reduced lignin, collapsed vessel elements, dwarf	11967091

2914:AT2G41210	pip5k4 pip5k5	Pollen harvested from pip5k4 pip5k5 mutants germinates at a lower rate than wild type pollen, and pollen tube growth is slowed. However, the general shape of the pollen tubes is normal.	19060112
2915:AT2G41210	pip5k5	pip5k5 mutants do not show any obvious defects in pollen germination or pollen tube growth. But, these processes are compromised in pip5k4 pip5k5 double mutants.	19060112

2920:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11	Double mutant plants displayed an enhanced cauline leaf outgrowth phenotype compared with bop1-4 plants.	17601823
2921:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11	LBD36/ASL1 transcript levels were not reduced in bop1-4 bop2-11 plants.
2924:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11	Mutant leaf petioles displayed clusters of densely cytoplasmic, undifferentiated cells on the adaxial side, coincident with the development of ectopic outgrowths.	17601823
2925:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11	Mutant plants developed extensive ectopic blade outgrowths along the rosette leaf petiole, like those observed in homozygous bop1-1 plants.	17601823

2927:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11	Whereas the gynoecium of wild-type flowers consists of two fused carpels ~50% of bop1-4 bop2-11 gynoecia contained only a single, fertile carpel.	17601823
2928:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11 as1-1	Mutant leaf petioles displayed clusters of densely cytoplasmic, undifferentiated cells on the adaxial side, coincident with the development of ectopic outgrowths.	17601823
2929:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11 as1-1	The rosette leaf petioles of the triple mutant plants showed extensive ectopic outgrowth  formation in the marginal region, and  some outgrowths exhibited a strongly radialized character.	17601823
2930:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11 as1-1	The vascular patterning defects in the triple mutant leaf petioles were greatly enhanced compared with those of the parental plants.	17601823

2933:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11 as2-1	The vascular patterning defects in the triple mutant leaf petioles were greatly enhanced compared with those of the parental plants.	17601823
2934:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	About nine-tenths of the mutants exhibited abaxialized vasculature. The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature.
2937:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves. However, all of the bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves also showed extended, radialized petiole development that was not observed in either parental genotype.
2940:AT2G41370	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems had a decreased ratio of adaxialized vascular phenotypes compared with kan1 kan2 stems. Similar to what was observed in petioles, 6.7% of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems exhibited an abaxialized phenotype of xylem surrounded by phloem, while others (13.3%) had both types of vasculature in a single stem.	17601823

2960:AT2G42260	uvi4	Fresh weight of mutant plants was 2.1 times higher than that of the wild-type plants when grown under supplemental UV-B light. Mutant plants were less sensitive to UV-B light. In addition, the mutant plants have overbranching trichomes on their leaves and stems.

2982:AT2G44750	AtTPK1/2-KO	These double knock-out mutants are thiamine auxotrophs that have a seedling lethal phenotype unless they are supplied with exogenous thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) through a spray-based application. In addition, these mutants have 2-fold higher levels of thiamine and 32-fold lower levels of TPP than wild type plants.	17611796
2983:AT2G44750	SALK_011765C	The AtTPK2-KO single mutant does not have any obvious aberrant phenotypes, but, the AtTPK1-KO /AtTPK2-KO double mutant demonstrates that these enzymes are required to produce thiamine pyrophosphate from thiamine.	17611796
2984:AT2G44900	arabidillo-1	No visible phenotype.	16434475
2986:AT2G44910	SALK_104843 (homo)	Under both FRc and Rc conditions, the length of mutant hypocotyls and cotyledon area are similar to that of wild type.	16891401
2987:AT2G44950	CS6134	Double mutant, reduced seed dormancy determined by the embryo; increased ability to germinate as freshly harvested seeds compared to each of the monogenic mutants; cumulative effect of the individual mutations suggest that they control different pathways; high capacity to germinate in darkness.	8587986
2988:AT2G44950	hub1-1	Reduced leaf size and narrow laminae.	10353913
2989:AT2G44950	hub1-1	The lamina area of mature first and second mutant leaves was reduced to 55% of that of the wild type. The length:width ratio was significantly increased, reflecting a much stronger reduction in width than in length of the blade. The mutation also affected rosette growth, reducing fresh and dry weight at flowering by 40 and 39%, respectively.
2993:AT2G44950	hub1-1	The number of palisade cells across mutant lamina was 44% that of those in wild type, resulting in narrow leaf shape of the mutant. In addition to reduced cell numbers, distribution and size of the mesophyll cells were irregular with some enlarged cells and the air spaces were increased.	17329565
2994:AT2G44950	hub1-1	The stomatal index was consistently reduced in all hub1-1 when compared with Ler samples, suggesting that a proportion of leaf epidermal cells of hub1-1 exit the mitotic cell cycle early. The stomatal index (i.e., the fraction of epidermal cells that are guard cells) increased more slowly in hub1-1 than in Ler between 5 and 8 DAS, with final values of 0.23 and 0.35 on average for hub1-1 and Ler, respectively. As a result, in mature leaves of hub1-1, fewer stomata were present, a difference that originated at the same time when division rates were changed.	17329565
2995:AT2G44950	hub1-2	Pleiotropic phenotypes, such as pale-green leaf color, increased bushy appearance, and more open flower buds.	17329563

2999:AT2G44950	hub1-2	The growth of hub1-2 seedlings on medium without sucrose is severely delayed compared with wild-type seedlings. Addition of 1.5% sucrose to the medium can rescue the delayed development of hub1-2, suggesting a defect in seedling establishment.	17329563
3001:AT2G44950	hub1-3	Slightly reduced seed dormancy compared with wild-type seeds.	17329563
3002:AT2G44950	hub1-3	The chlorophyll content index in the mutant is lower than in wild type.	17329563
3003:AT2G44950	hub1-3 hub2-2	The chlorophyll content index of the double mutant did not differ from the single mutants, and the germination percentage of freshly harvested seeds was slightly higher than that of the single mutants.	17329563

3007:AT2G44950	hub1-4	The chlorophyll content index in the mutant is lower than in wild type.	17329563
3008:AT2G44950	hub1-4	The flowering of hub1-4 mutants is accelerated compared to wild type plants under long days and short days. In addition, the plants are small and have pale green leaves. Histone2B ubiquitination is lost in hub1-4 mutants. FLC expression is suppressed in these mutants.

3052:AT2G45770	frd4-1	Chlorophyll levels in the mutant are dramatically reduced to ~20% of those of wild type.	16813577
3056:AT2G45770	frd4-1	Leaf cells from mutant plants were slightly smaller than wild-type leaf cells and contained fewer chloroplasts per cell.

3064:AT2G45970	lcr	Abnormalities in cell morphology in lcr-3P77: These were very often observed as bulges consisting of several cells and as abnormally large roundish cells. The development of trichomes was also found to be affected in a way that suggested that cell differentiation was retarded in lcr-3P77 compared with wild-type plants.
3067:AT2G45970	lcr	Detached leaves of lcr were apparently able to obtain the required water and mineral nutrients through the sutures with contacting leaves, suggesting that the lipid boundary at the exterior epidermal cell walls in lcr-3P77 mutants becomes permeable or may even disappear upon fusion.
3070:AT2G45970	lcr	Fusions between rosette leaves and in inflorescences.	11493698
3071:AT2G45970	lcr	Mutant plants generally produced fertile flowers and displayed relatively weak fusions in inflorescences.	11493698
3072:AT2G45970	lcr	Mutant plants reached a lower height and had an increased number of shoots, relative to wild type, implying that apical dominance was reduced; delayed senescence, irregular leaf shapes and lower fertility compared with wild-type plants were also noted.
3075:AT2G45970	lcr	Some 3P77 plants exhibited extremely strong fusions resulting in tearing of leaf tissues during their growth. Occasionally, petioles of some fused leaves have been forced to tear; however, the detached leaves did not senesce and remained green for several days.	11493698

3098:AT2G46370	CS8072	The mutant exhibits a significant flg22-induced reduction in bacterial growth, indicating that the gene is most probably not required for flg22-induced bacterial resistance.	15085136
3100:AT2G46370	jar1-8	JA-Ile levels are roughly eight-fold lower in the jar1-8 mutant compared to wild type plants. The levels of JA, JA-Val, and JA-Leu are similar in the wild-type and mutant backgrounds, whereas the level of JA-Phe and JA-ACC are higher in the mutant.	15258265
3104:AT2G46510	ataib	Weak insensitivity to ABA.	17828375
3105:AT2G46530	CS24612	no obvious auxin-related growth phenotype	15659631
3106:AT2G46685	men1	Severe growth retardation.  Pleiotropic alterations in the inflorescence stem and leaf morphologies and floral structure.  Fasciated inflorescence stem with disrupted radial vascular patterning, apical meristem enlargement.  Number of flowers is increased with respect to wild type, carpels are very short and sterile.	15773855
3107:AT2G46770	nst1-1 nst3-1	Plants are indehiscent because siliques lack secondary walls except in vascular vessels.	18657234
3108:AT2G46770	nst1-1 nst3-1	Under short-day conditions, the nst1-1 nst3-1 plants were no longer able to remain upright when they reached >15cmin height neither lignin nor cellulose, which constitute secondary walls, was produced in inflorescence stems of nst1-1 nst3-1 plants,
3111:AT2G46770	nst1-1/ful	The ectopic formation of secondary walls normally seen in the ful mutant is suppressed in the double mutant.	18657234
3112:AT2G46770	nst1-2	Secondary walls of valve margins do not form and those of the enB layer form late. Lack of secondary walls mean causes siliques to be indehiscent.	18657234
3113:AT2G46790	CS9385	Under FRc conditions, the length mutant hypocotyls is similar to that of wild-type plants.  Under Rc conditions, the hypocotyl length is increased compared to wild type and the cotyledon area is smaller.	16891401
3114:AT2G46790	prr7-3prr9-1	double mutant shows dramatic and more than additive period lengthening in the light and becomes arrhythmic in constant darkness. Fails both to maintain an oscillation after entrainment to thermocycles and to reset its clock in response to cold pulses.	15705949
3115:AT2G46830	cca1-1	In mutant plants transferred to constant light after entrainment in light:dark conditions (12 h of light:12 h of darkness), the period of Lhcb1*1 circadian oscillations was ~3 h shorter than that in wild-type plants grown under the same conditions. On the first day of the experiment, the timing of the increase of Lhcb1*1 RNA in cca1-1 plants was almost identical to that in wild-type plants. However, by the fourth day of the experiment, the Lhcb1*1 RNA peaked much earlier in cca1-1 than in wild-type plants.	10097183
3116:AT2G46830	cca1-1	Under both FRc and Rc conditions, the length of mutant hypocotyls and cotyledon area are similar to that of wild type.	16891401

3120:AT2G46920	pol-6 pll1-1	Embryo lethal, due to major defects in embryo patterning.	17079273
3121:AT2G46970	pil1	As in the La-er ecotype (mutant background Col), a single exposure of knockout mutant seedlings to 2 h of low R/FR at subjective dusk is sufficient to induce a significant promotion of hypocotyl elongation, whereas a similar treatment at subjective dawn leads to an inhibition of elongation.	14668869
3122:AT2G46970	pil1	Mutant seedlings exhibit a significant shift (~6 h) in the phase of the circadian rhythm of hypocotyl elongation responses to low R/FR.	14668869
3123:AT2G46970	pil1	The mutant seedlings display a marked attenuation of the maximal promotion of elongation by transient low R/FR and an increase in the magnitude of the growth inhibition caused by transient low R/FR at subjective dawn.	14668869
3124:AT2G46970	pil1-1 (Kasuka)	The circadian-associated phenotypes, including flowering time and red light sensitivity during early photomorphogenesis (i.e. elongation of  hypocotyls) are identical between wild type and mutant.	12826627
3125:AT2G46970	pil1-2 (Kasuka)	The circadian-associated phenotypes, including flowering time and red light sensitivity during early photomorphogenesis (i.e. elongation of  hypocotyls) are identical between wild type and mutant.	12826627
3126:AT2G46970	pil1-2 (SALK)	Under FRc conditions, the length mutant hypocotyls is increased compared to that of wild-type plants.  Under Rc conditions, the hypocotyl length is also increased and the cotyledon area is smaller.	16891401
3135:AT2G47160	bor1-1	Requires a high level of B. When the B concentration in the medium was reduced to 3 microM, the expansion of rosette leaves was severely affected in bor1-1 but not in wild-type plants. In a medium containing 30 microM B the mutant grew normally but showed female sterility, whereas the wild type was able to set seeds. These defects of the bor1-1 mutant were not detected with supplementation of 100 microM B. In vivo concentrations of B in bor1-1 mutants were lower than those of the wild type, especially in the inflorescence stems.	9390427
3136:AT2G47220	SALK_112134	Homozygotes have a WT phenotype	19795213
3137:AT2G47240	lacs1-1 lacs2-3	The lacs1-1 lacs2-3 double mutants had a synergistic phenotype, compared to either of the single mutants, with drastically reduced stem wax and cutin contents, increased cuticle permeability, and severe male sterile in low humidity.	19392700
3139:AT2G47470	FLAG_427G04	Reduced seed set due to delayed development of embryo sacs and resulting defect in pollen tube guidance.	19050167
3140:AT2G47470	SALK_046705	Reduced seed set. Delayed embryo sac development results in defects in pollen tube guidance.	19050167
3141:AT2G47585	mir164a-4	Increased leaf serration.	17098808
3142:AT2G47585	mir164abc	Plants appear normal during vegetative growth. Phenotypic alterations start after the switch to reproductive development. Flowers have an increased number of sepals and petals. Floral organ numbers are highly variable. Individual organs varied in size. Carpels failed to fuse resulting in severe reduction of fertility. In addition, plants display a highly unequal and distorted arrangement of flowers, both with respect to the angle formed by two consecutive flowers and their distance from each other along the axis of the stem.	17287247
3144:AT2G47990	swa1	Plants heterozygous for the swa1 mutation had shorter siliques, aborted ovules, and showed a semisterile phenotype. The mutation mainly impaired female gametogenesis and caused a minor defect during male gametogenesis. Confocal microscopy revealed that megagametophyte development was asynchronous in swa1, causing embryo sacs to arrest at two-, four-, or eight-nucleate stages within the same pistil. A small fraction of the swa1 embryo sacs were able to develop into functional female gametophytes. The swa1 mutation also showed a slight reduction in penetrance through the male gametophyte, although the pollen grains were morphologically normal.	15980260

3189:AT3G02130	rpk2-1	The homozygous progeny is indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth but showed several morphological alterations after bolting. These plants displayed enhanced inflorescence branching and formed three times as many siliques and flowers as did wild-type plants.	17419837
3190:AT3G02130	rpk2-2	At the flowering stage, the flowers of the homozygous progeny showed normal floral structures consisting of the four floral organs: sepals, petals, stamens and carpels. However, the mutant flowers contained no dehiscent anthers, whereas wild-type flowers developed dehiscent anthers with dispersed pollen grains. The three-dimensional surface images revealed that the wild-type anthers at flowering stage were broken and many pollen grains released, while mutant anthers remained enlarged yet failed to dehisce.
3193:AT3G02130	rpk2-2	Homozygous progeny developed more spindly shoots with shorter siliques than the wild type.	17419837
3194:AT3G02130	rpk2-2	Male sterile.	17419837

3196:AT3G02130	rpk2-2	The homozygous progeny is indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth but showed several morphological alterations after bolting. These plants displayed enhanced inflorescence branching and formed three times as many siliques and flowers as did wild-type plants.	17419837
3197:AT3G02130	rpk2-2	Thickening of the endothecium in rpk2-2 anthers was inhibited; this tissue remained as a thin  layer during stages 11-13.	17419837
3198:AT3G02130	rpk2-2	Whereas development of the rpk2-2 anther locules proceeded normally until stage 4, inner secondary parietal cells directly differentiated into tapetum but did not give rise to the middle layer. Microspore mother cells in the rpk2-2 anthers underwent meiosis and formed tetrads between stages 5 and 7. However, subsequent development of microspores was inhibited and deformed microspores that partially aggregated were observed at stage 11.	17419837
3199:AT3G02130	rpk2-2	Whereas the surface structure of wildtype pollen grains consisted of elliptical balls with three grooves and a striped exine pattern. By contrast, several rpk2-2 pollens showed deformed ellipses and a partially smooth surface, with most pollen grains highly aggregated together.

3216:AT3G02310	sep1 sep2 sep3	All flower organs resemble sepals. The second whorl has four green sepal-like organs (instead of four white petals) which are differentiated of interspersed stomata and the conversion of nearly all of the cells into sepal cells. Sepals replace stamens in the third whorl. The fourth whorl is a reiteration of whorls 1, 2 and 3.	10821278
3217:AT3G02310	sep1 sep2 sep3 sep4	All flower organs are converted to leaf-like organs, most strikingly on their adaxial surface. Abaxial epidermal cells are made up of a mixture of leaf- and sepal-like characteristics. Leaf characteristics include an abundance of branched trichomes.	15530395

3251:AT3G04460	SALK_013612	Embryonic lethal in homozygotes. In heterozygous plants immature siliques  had approximately 22% white seeds, which  became purplish and shriveled as the siliques matured. Knockout embryos showed retarded growth and in most cases were able to  develop to the heart stage, but failed to grow further  into torpedo and mature embryos. Null embryos lacked peroxisomes, contained small and underdeveloped  plastids, and were missing characteristic lipid body structures.	16113209
3252:AT3G04460	apm4	apm4 mutants showed decreased efficiency of PTS1- and PTS2- (peroxisome targeting signal)-dependent protein transport into peroxisome.  apm4 mutation also represses plant growth.	16813573

Mutant growth not rescued with exogenous addition of metabolically related amino acids. Significant alteration in the amino acid profiles of most plant tissue types, increased seed Threonine (Thr) content; reduced Glicyn (a product of Thr aldolase reaction) content in all plant tissues; increased branched-chain amino acids (Ile, Leu and Val) in vegetative tissues, except in stems, where there is a decrease. Reduced levels of organic acids and sugars, citrate and isocitrate levels in seeds and flowers are significantly lower than in wild type; levels of most sugars are significantly decreased in flowers and siliques.	17172352
3254:AT3G04520	CS6935	Seeds, seedlings and whole homozygous plants do not show any visible phenotypic differences compared to wild type; not lethal.

3259:AT3G04680	clps3-1	Homozygous clps3-1 mutants cannot be generated. Reciprocal crosses using the gametes from a clps3-1 heterozygote indicate that wild-type and clps3-1 pollen are equally efficient in fertilizing wild type plants. But, there is roughly a 50% reduction in transmission of the clps3-1 mutant female gametophyte. No embryo development can be observed in a presumed homozygote indicating lethality at a very early stage after fertilization. Expression of 35S:CLPS3:TAP rescues the embryo lethality phenotype.	18971429

In the dark, hypocotyl growth is significantly less than the wild type. Has less than 2% of L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, and reduced 2-trans-enoyl-CoA hydratase activity towards long chain enoyl-CoAs. Accumulated 2.5-fold more long chain acyl-CoAs in 5-day-old seedlings. Has fewer but larger peroxisomes.	16507084
3322:AT3G06930	SALK_097442c	atprmt4b-1 mutants do not have any obvious phenotypic defects when compared to wild-type plants. But, the double mutants atprmt4a-1 atprmt4b-1 and atprmt4a-2 atprmt4b-1 have delayed flowering under long days.	18660432
3323:AT3G06930	atprmt4a-2 atprmt4b-1	These double mutants have delayed flowering compared to wild type plants when grown under long day conditions. Analysis of growth under short day conditions indicates that these mutants are not disrupted in the photoperiod pathway. These double mutants also seem to be able to respond to vernalization signals and to gibberellin. But they have an impaired autonomous pathway to flowering. FLC transcripts are up-regulated in these double mutants through an unknown mechanism. The global level of asymmetric dimethylation of arginine 17 in histone 3 (H3)is reduced in these mutants. The transcript levels for several repressors of FLC do not seem to be altered in the double mutants, nor are there discernible changes in several types of H3 modifications at the FLC locus.	18660432

There was no observable difference in vegetative growth between the heterozygous mutant (cs9/+) and the wild-type plant.cs9/+ hetrozygotes exhibited precocious pollen germination inside the anthers. This phenotype was exacerbated by high humidity.
3334:AT3G07160	SALK_124294	Pollen grains carrying cs9-6 are gametophytic lethal. No cs9-6 homozygotes could  be obtained from the self-pollination of cs9/+ heterozygotes.

3339:AT3G07430	YLMG1-1 ox	Larger, but fewer chloroplasts than WT.   FtsZ ring formation is perturbed, and consequently chloroplast  division.
3342:AT3G07430	ylmg1-1 antisense	Young emerging leaves  and the basal part of expanding leaves exhibited a palegreen  phenotype. As leaves matured, the leaf color shifted  to green, with no obvious difference compared to the  wild-type leaves.  The shape and size  of chloroplasts in expanding leaves were similar to those  in the wild type. However, in the basal part of expanding leaf of the  antisense line, chloroplasts were pale and smaller than  those of the wild type. Interestingly,  nucleoids were concentrated in a few large structures  in both the tip and basal part of the expanding  leaves of the antisense line.

3347:AT3G07610	SALK_035608C	The ibm1-4 mutation causes hypermethylation of the BONSAI (At1g73177) locus in the first generation in which the mutant allele becomes homozygous, and there is a higher level of H3mK9 at the BONSAI locus in ibm1-4 mutant than in wild type rosette leaves. ibm1-4 mutants have morphological defects that become apparent at the F3 generation, including small narrow leaves, arrested flower development, and faulty pollen development. The growth defects observed in ibm1-4 are exacerbated in a ddm1-1 mutant background ddm1-1has also been shown to cause BONSAI hypermethylation. Meanwhile, DNA methylation and developmental defects are suppressed in kyp (At5g13960) and cmt3 (At1g69770) mutant backgrounds.	18218897
3348:AT3G07610	ibm1-1	The ibm1-1 mutation causes hypermethylation of the BONSAI (At1g73177) locus in the first generation in which the mutant allele becomes homozygous. The BONSAI gene undergoes cytosine methylation, primarily associated with non-CG  sites in the ibm1-1 mutant, whereas there is almost no evidence of cytosine methylation at this locus in wild type seedlings. Methylation at repetitive regions, including centromeric satellites, or 5S rRNA genes are not compromised in the ibm1-1 mutant. ibm1-1 mutants have morphological defects that become apparent at the F3 generation, including small narrow leaves, arrested flower development, and faulty pollen development.	18218897

3768:AT3G24650	abi3-3	abi3-3 plants exhibited severe seed-specific developmental defects, namely reduced dormancy and severely reduced accumulation of seed reserve proteins. The embryos remained green throughout development and were desiccation intolerant. However, immature seeds were completely non-dormant and grow normally. The morphological development of abi3-3 embryos does not appear to differ from wild-type, and if imbibed 10 DAF the seeds germinate to produce normal looking plantlets. However, if the embryos are left to desiccate they do not germinate. It appears that AB13 gene product is not essential for morphogenetic development of the embryo, but is required for protection of the embryo prior to desiccation.	
3769:AT3G24650	abi3-6	Impaired degreening during seed maturation - embryos were green throughout seed development and seeds are green at maturity and first true leaves were already formed at this stage. Embryo at maturity had fewer protein bodies, instead, large vacuoles were observed in cotyledons. Freshly harvested seeds germinated on wet filter paper within 2-3 days. Chloroplasts were observed in cotyledons of mutants seedlings grown in dark as well as in the true leaves. Seed phenotype of abi3-6 is indistinguishable from abi3-3 allele.	10634906

3815:AT3G27670	rst1-1	Mutant plants showed alterations in the cuticular wax profiles and embryo development. Compared to wild type, the wax on inflorescence stems in mutants is reduced nearly 60% in total amount, has a proportional reduction in aldehydes and aldehyde metabolites, and has a proportional increase in acids, primary alcohols, and esters. Also, the C29 alkanes in mutants are nearly 6-fold lower, and the C30 primary alcohols are 4-fold higher compared to the wild type. In contrast to stems, the wax on mutant leaves increased roughly 43% in amount relative to the wild type, with the major increase occurring in the C31 and C33 alkanes. Approximately 70% of mutant seeds are shrunken and nonviable, with these being randomly distributed within both inflorescence and silique. Viable mutant seeds are slightly larger than those of wild type; the proportions of these fatty acids are not significantly different from wild type. Shrunken seeds contain 34% of the fatty acids of wild-type seeds, with proportionally more palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, and less of the longer and more desaturated homologs. Histological analysis of aborted rst1 seeds revealed that embryo development terminates at the approximate heart-shaped stage, whereas viable rst1 and wild-type embryos develop similarly.	16183838

Aspartic acid was the only amino acid which showed a significant reduction in wild-type plants during dehydration. In dehydrated tissues of the mutant, 9 amino acids increased more than 2-fold during dehydration, however the increases in the mutant plants were less pronounced than those in wild-type plants. Glycine and alanine showed greater increases in comparison to wild type, whereas the levels of glutamic acid and aspartic acid showed a reduction in the mutant during dehydration.
3844:AT3G27920	aba2-2	Free amino acid levels in fresh tissues of the mutant plants at 30 DAI were similar to those in wild type, however the level of proline in the mutant plants was 4-fold higher than that in wild type.	9787459

3870:AT3G27920	tert	50% of the mitotic nuclei in anaphase from tert mutants with severe growth defects (in the G8 generation) have anaphase bridges, while none are found in comparable wild type controls. These anaphase bridges occur disproportionately often between rDNA regions. A number of chromosomal defects can also be visualized during metaphase in these mutants. About 30% of the leaf mesophyll cells examined in tert G8 mutants have elevated numbers of nucleoli.	14579127
3871:AT3G27920	tert	No obvious phenotypic changes in the first (G1) or second (G2) generation. However, starting in G1, the telomeric smear in AtTERT-deficient plants was replaced by several sharp bands. By G2 at least 11 discrete telomeric fragments were visible.

3893:AT3G29320	atphs1-1	The leaves of mature mutant plants  consistently had small, white lesions on the tips or margins of fully expanded leaves. The lesions did not increase in size after appearance and were not bordered by chlorotic tissue. The frequency and severity of lesions varied between batches of plants, but lesion-free mutant plants were rare. Further examination of the lesions on leaves of the mutant plants revealed that high levels of starch were present in the living cells bordering each lesion at the end of the night, when the rest of the leaf had metabolized its starch. This starch accumulation occurred in a highly  cell-specific manner with adjacent starch-rich and starch-free cells.	15173560

3924:AT3G44880	pao1	This mutant develops a lesion-mimic phenotype on the leaves similar to that of several acd1 mutants. The lesions occur in a development-related, light-dependent fashion, coinciding with the initiation of leaf senescence in the wild-type. Premature cell death was observed in the flowers. Sepals and petals started to degrade earlier than that of wild-type, resulting in flowers that fail to fully open. 40% of seeds aborts at an early stage of development.	16113212

3940:AT3G47450	CS6511	sensitive to ozone (O3)	19054359
3941:AT3G47450	rif1-1	rif1-1 mutants are pale green with delayed leaf development. They have a strong resistance to fosmidomycin (FSM), an inhibitor of the isoprenoid biosynthetic enzyme DXR. The reduced rate of degradation of DXS and DXR in rif1-1 mutants leads to a higher accumulation of these two MEP biosynthetic enzymes. Though RIF1 was originally believed to be an NO-synthase, treatment with an NO donor, does not rescue the DXR over-accumulation phenotype, implying that this is not an NO-dependent phenotype. There is a reduction in the level of the large subunit of Rubisco, and two other plastid-encoded proteins in the rif1-1 mutant, however, levels of the plastid-encoded ClpP1 protease are elevated in rif1-1 mutants, compared to wild type seedlings. A plastid-targeted YqeH-GFP construct can rescue the growth, pigmentation, and FSM-resistance phenotypes of rif1-1. YqeH is a GTPase implicated in ribosomal biogenesis in bacteria.	18469163
3942:AT3G47500	SAIL_434_G09 (homo)	Under FRc conditions, the length mutant hypocotyls is similar to that of wild-type plants.  Under Rc conditions, the hypocotyl length is decreased and the cotyledon area is similar to that of wild type.	16891401
3944:AT3G47700	mag2-1	Mutant seeds accumulated the precursors of 12S globulin and 2S albumin, and increased level of ER-localized chaperones.

3952:AT3G48090	eds1-2	The mutant exhibits a significant flg22-induced reduction in bacterial growth, indicating that the gene is most probably not required for flg22-induced bacterial resistance.	15085136
3953:AT3G48160	del1-1	Epidermal cells on abaxial surface have increased DNA content.	18787127
3954:AT3G48190	atm / tert	During five generations of growth, both tert and atm/tert lose about 500 bp of chromosome length per generation. But, whereas tert mutants show no visible growth defects through the G6 generation, atm/tert mutants in G5 show severe growth defects, such as aberrant leaf shape, delayed flowering, a loss of apical dominance, and reduced fertility. atm/tert mutants in G5 have a much higher rate of bridged chromosomes than G5 tert mutants.	16166376
3955:AT3G48190	atm / tert	atm tert mutants undergo Telomere Rapid Deletion (TRD) events, that can lead to the production of a chromosome with a very short telomere. Just one of these structures can  prompt end-to-end chromosomal fusion events in the G5 generation. The anaphase bridges apparent in these atm/tert mutants seem to involve only a single chromosome in each distinct mutant line, and seem to occur between sister chromatids. These plants exhibit the same overall level of aneuploidy in the G5 generation as tert mutants do in the G6 generation (~52% of cells showing abnormal centromeric signals in interphase). atm/tert mutants are not as likely to undergo ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent process) as tert mutants, implicating ATM in this process.	17989233
3956:AT3G48190	atr/atm	Double mutants are defective in telomere maintainance. Mutants form anaphase bridges.	16166376
3957:AT3G48250	bir6-1	Mutation of BIR6 affects splicing of intron 1 of mitochondrial nad7 transcript, leading to strongly reduced accumulation of fully processed nad7 transcript. This affects assembly of Complex I and results in moderate growth retardation.	20682769

3964:AT3G48430	SALK_001018C	ref6-1 mutant seedlings do not have any obvious aberrant phenotypes under light-grown conditions, but they do have a late flowering phenotype. Adult plants have reduced cell elongation, manifested in a ~30% reduction in leaf petiole length as well as shorter leaf blades, but their leaf width is similar to wild-type. The transcript levels of some BR-regulated genes are reduced in ref6-1 mutants. H3K9me3 levels are elevated immediately upstream of the BR-responsive TCH4 gene in ref6-1 mutants.	18467490
3965:AT3G48430	SALK_001018C	ref6-1 mutants flower later than wild-type plants under long- and short-day conditions even though they have the same leaf initiation rate as wild-type plants. FLC mRNA levels are increased in ref6-1 mutants.	15377760

3967:AT3G48430	ref6-3	ref6-3 mutants flower later than wild-type plants under long- and short-day conditions.  Levels of H4 histone acetylation in the the promoter and in the first intron of FLC are reduced in ref6-3 mutants compared to wild-type plants.	15377760

3969:AT3G48750	SALK_106809	Homozygous are lethal. In self-fertilized heterozygous, severe seed defects were observed  in the mature siliques, whereas no obvious defect was observed before the reproductive stage. The mature siliques contain normal and  aborted seeds at a 1:1 ratio.  Male gametophytic lethal. Microspores normally undergo an  asymmetric cell division, pollen mitosis I (PMI), to produce bicellular pollen grains. The larger vegetative cell  does not divide, but the smaller generative cell undergoes mitosis, PMII, to form the two sperm cells, thereby  generating tricellular pollen grains. Embryo is arrested at the  globular stage, most likely because of loss of endosperm development, whereas it is arrested at the one- or  two-cell stage in presumptive homozygous plants	16460514
3970:AT3G48750	T161D	strongly decreased kinase activity, T161D plants showed various developmental defects; strongly reduced in growth. contained embryos that were small and displayed cotyledons that did not fold to one side; exhibited fewer but enlarged cells After germination, fewer and smaller leaves were generated by the T161D plants. Sterile phenotype; although all floral organs were present, the plants were entirely female- and male-sterile
3973:AT3G48750	cdc2a-2	Reduced fertility, failure to transmit through pollen. Pollen development affected at the second mitotic division resulting in pollen with a single generative and vegetative cell. Pollen can germinate and fertilize the egg cell but embryos arrest. Unfertilized endosperm develops.	16311592
3974:AT3G48780	Atlcb2a-1 Atlcb2b-1	Double mutant is male gametophytic lethal due to defects in pollen development. Phenotype of the double mutant pollens became apparent in the bicellular stage. The cytoplasm was less dense and plastids were dilated and lacked oil droplets. The nuclear envelope structure was modified by the formation of vesicles between the inner and outer membranes. The microspores lacked the intine layer, and consequently lacked clearly defined ER and Golgi.	18208516
3975:AT3G49170	CS16045	Embryos consistently initiated cotyledons and continued growth and cell division beyond heart stage.  Embryos consistently failed to elongate, developing instead as v-shaped embryos with wide,stunted cotyledons and no hypocotyl.	15647901
3976:AT3G49240	CS16034	Embryo fails to develop beyond the globular stage.  Consisten and severe developmental arrest at the mid-globular stage, resulting in a slightly irregular embryo proper consisting of 32-64 cells.

4015:AT3G49600	Atubp26-2	In homozygous plants 20% of ovules fail to form seeds. Ovules that do not produce seeds do not produce embryo sacs. Among the remaining ovule that do form embryo sacs and embryos more than 50% of the embryos abort at various stages. With fewer seeds the siliques of homozygous plants are shorter. Later formed flowers have non-dehiscent anthers.	18723879
4016:AT3G49670	bam1-1 bam2-1	Anthers in double mutant plants appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective.	16751349

4052:AT3G51060	sty1-1	When grown under long day, mutant plants were essentially the same as wild type plants, except showing some morphological aberrations restricted to the apical part of the gynoecium. Mature styles exhibited slight depression and were generally wider that in the wild type. Style epidermal cells were found at the edges of the stigma, where stigmatic papillae were formed in the WT. Papillae tent to sprawl in all directions. The outer replum is broader in mutant gynoecia. Uppermost portion of the siliques was narrowed, as a result of aborted uppermost ovules in the siliques.	12361963
4053:AT3G51060	sty1-1 ett-1	The gynoecial defects of ett-1 mutants, such as reduction in ovary size and increased gynophore elongation, were enhanced by the sty1-1 mutation. A number of double mutant gynoecia were nearly completely valveless, and in those, ovules grew on top of a placental surface. In addition, the apical ends of sty1-1 ett-1 gynoecia were less fused than those of ett-1 and sty1-1, and ovules frequently protruded at the apex. The amount of stylar and stigmatic tissues was reduced compared with ett-1, and the double mutant was sterile. As in ett-1 gynoecia, ectopic tissue of transmitting tract identity was generally present.	16740145

4158:AT3G54320	wri1-1	The pattern of G6PDH activity is not altered in the mutant compared to wildtype; only a slight delay in increase of AGPase activity is detected.	16553903
4159:AT3G54320	wri1-1	The wri1 has seed-specific phenotype, characterized by the wrinkledness of the seed and a strong reduction in the accumulation of seed oil. No striking differences between the wild-type and mutant plants were observed, in particular with respect to the number of siliques or seeds, a factor that could affect seed filling. Furthermore, the number of siliques per plant as well as the number of seeds per silique were not altered in the wri1 mutants. Early morphogenesis of the embryo as observed by light microscopy was indistinguishable in the mutants and the wild type, however, during the seed-filling stage triacylglycerols accumulated at a much lower rate in the mutant, and the final amount of triacylglycerols in mature wri1 mutant seeds was reduced by approximately 80%. The fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols extracted from mature wild-type and homozygous wri1 mutant seeds were different. There were only subtle differences in the time courses of protein accumulation during seed development between the mutants and the wild type. It appears that young mutant seeds contain more protein, whereas mature mutant seeds contain slightly less than wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the amounts of soluble sugars, including Suc, Glc, and Fru, were elevated throughout development of wri1 mutant seeds. Mature mutant seeds contained approximately twice as much Suc. However, developing homozygous wri1 seeds were impaired in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols; pyruvate and acetate were incorporated at an increased rate. Because the activities of several glycolytic enzymes, in particular hexokinase and pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, are reduced in developing homozygous wri1 seeds, it is suggested that WRI1is involved in the developmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism during seed filling.	9733529
4160:AT3G54320	wri1-2	The wri1 has seed-specific phenotype, characterized by the wrinkledness of the seed and a strong reduction in the accumulation of seed oil. No striking differences between the wild-type and mutant plants were observed, in particular with respect to the number of siliques or seeds, a factor that could affect seed filling. Furthermore, the number of siliques per plant as well as the number of seeds per silique were not altered in the wri1 mutants. Early morphogenesis of the embryo as observed by light microscopy was indistinguishable in the mutants and the wild type, however, during the seed-filling stage triacylglycerols accumulated at a much lower rate in the mutant, and the final amount of triacylglycerols in mature wri1 mutant seeds was reduced by approximately 80%. The fatty acid composition of triacylglycerols extracted from mature wild-type and homozygous wri1 mutant seeds were different. There were only subtle differences in the time courses of protein accumulation during seed development between the mutants and the wild type. It appears that young mutant seeds contain more protein, whereas mature mutant seeds contain slightly less than wild-type seeds. Furthermore, the amounts of soluble sugars, including Suc, Glc, and Fru, were elevated throughout development of wri1 mutant seeds. Mature mutant seeds contained approximately twice as much Suc. However, developing homozygous wri1 seeds were impaired in the incorporation of sucrose and glucose into triacylglycerols; pyruvate and acetate were incorporated at an increased rate. Because the activities of several glycolytic enzymes, in particular hexokinase and pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, are reduced in developing homozygous wri1 seeds, it is suggested that WRI1is involved in the developmental regulation of carbohydrate metabolism during seed filling.	9733529

A reduction in  the light-induced opening of peeled epidermis was observed compared  with that in detached whole leaves. Stomatal apertures  reached maximal opening after 4 h of illumination. The  stomatal apertures of PtdIns(4,5)P2-treated pip5k4 (2.94 &mu;m) were similar to those of WT (3.02 &mu;m), and significantly larger than those of pip5k4  without treatment (2.32 &mu;m).  The stomatal apertures of PtdIns(4)P- and PtdIns(3,4)P2-  treated pip5k4 plants were not significantly different from  those of untreated pip5k4 plants.

The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature.
4230:AT3G57130	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves.

4242:AT3G57670	ntt-1	In the mutant, pollen tubes have considerable difficulty growing within the transmitting tract, causing them to terminate travel prematurely and frequently to leave the transmitting tract.	17600712
4243:AT3G57670	ntt-1	In wildtype, 62% of the seeds were found in the bottom half of the silique (50-100 percentile) and 5% were found in the apical region (0-20 percentile). On average, seeds formed toward the center of the silique (50?60 percentile). No preference was observed for fertilization of the  most apical ovules. In the ntt mutant, most seed formed in the upper half of the carpel (90%).	17600712
4244:AT3G57670	ntt-1	Only female reproductive tissue is affected in the mutant, as shown by the fact that mutant pollen produces a normal seed set when applied to wild-type flowers.

In wild-type carpels, the first pollen tubes reach the  base of the ovary after 10 hr, whereas in ntt carpels, pollen tubes made little additional progress. Even after 48 hr, pollen tubes in the ntt mutant had penetrated only approximately a third of the way into the ovary chamber.	17600712

4291:AT3G60830	arp7-1	All the heterozygous mutant plants were morphologically similar to wildtype  plants under normal growth conditions. Mutant siliques revealed abortion of a significant number of seeds (25%). Seeds were small, white, or brown and shriveled. Those abnormal  seeds contained small, rudimentary embryos that were arrested early during development at torpedo and bent-cotyledon stages. The 25%  aborted homozygous embryos were rudimentary  and arrested at or before the torpedo stage of development. Despite aberrant embryo development, endosperm development, and enlargement of seeds,  harboring small mutant embryos appeared normal  until the late torpedo stage, after which the endosperm  and the integument layers started to disintegrate.  Eventually the seeds turned brownish and dried out prematurely.	16040647

4614:AT4G14220	SALK_042445C	The rhf1a mutant does not have any visibly aberrant phenotypes, but, an rhf1a rhf2a double mutant reveals the role of these two proteins in gametogenesis and proteolysis.	18552199
4615:AT4G14220	rhf1a rhf2a	This double mutant has shorter siliques than WT plants, and lower fertility. Approximately 60% of ovules abort the megagametophytic development process at the FG1 stage. Often, one of the megaspores that is supposed to degenerate remains visible in the rhf1a rhf2a megagametophyte for a prolonged period of time. Some of the mutants arrested at the two nucleate (F2) stage, whereas about 30% developed normal female gametophytes that could be successfully fertilized to produce viable seed. The pollen of the double mutant is largely defective with about 50-70% nonviability compared to ~0.5% nonviability for wild type pollen. The pollen for rhf1a rhf2a mutants appears to develop normally through PMI, but 30-40% of the pollen grain fail to undergo this mitotic division, and then, of those that did pass through, another 20-30% never go through the next round of cell division (PMII). The variety of different ploidy levels measured in generative cells arrested at the PMII phase indicate that they could be blocked at the G1, S, or G2. Levels of myc:KRP6 increase in the double mutant, suggesting that this protein is a putative substrate of this E3 ubiquitin ligase. And many of the aberrant phenotypes observed in the double mutant can be improved when KRP6 levels are decreased by RNAi.	18552199

4619:AT4G14695	SAIL_667_C04 (homo)	Under FRc conditions, the length mutant hypocotyls is decreased compared to that of wild-type plants.  Under Rc conditions, the hypocotyl length is decreased and the cotyledon area is similar to that of wild type.	16891401
4620:AT4G14713	SALK_057237c	Weak semidominant ppd silique phenotype, i.e., similar to deltappd mutant, and leaf curvature phenotype.	16916932
4621:AT4G14713	deltappd	Mutant plants had larger leaf and cotyledon laminae, and leaves had a dome-shaped, positive Gaussian curvature, in contrast to flat WT leaves. Mutant siliques were shorter, flattened, and wider at the top and had undulations in the seedpod walls, compared with the smooth, narrow, cylindrical shape of WT siliques. Branching of trichomes on mutant leaves was reduced, to two rather than the three to four branches of WT. The larger lamina area observed in the leaves and cotyledons of mutant plants was due to increases in both length and width. For cotyledons, this increase in growth occurred without affecting shape or flatness. However, mature leaves in mutant plants were more oval in shape because of an altered lamina length-to-width ratio and could not be flattened without introducing cuts in the margin because of their positive curvature.	16916932

4657:AT4G16760	acx1-1	A sucrose-independent germination phenotype. Mutants have reduced medium- and long-chain Acyl-CoA enzyme activity. Lipid catabolism during germination and early post-germinative growth was unaltered in the acx1-1 mutant; seedling growth and establishment in the absence of an exogenous supply of sucrose was unaffected. Jasmonic acid accumulation was largely reduced upon wounding of mutant plants when compared to the wild type.	16146525
4658:AT4G16760	acx1-1 acx2-1	Double mutant seedlings were unable to catabolize seed storage lipids and accumulated long-chain acyl-CoAs. The acx1-1 acx2-1 seedlings were also unable to establish photosynthetic competency in the absence of an exogenous carbon supply, a phenotype that is shared with a number of other Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in storage lipid breakdown. Germination frequency of the double mutant was significantly reduced compared with wild-type seeds. This was unaffected by the addition of exogenous sucrose, but was improved by dormancy-breaking treatments such as cold stratification and after-ripening.  Peroxisomes in the cotyledons were enlarged in double mutants, while in single mutants (acx1-1 and acx2-1) peroxisomes were identical to the wild type.	16146525

4674:AT4G17380	Atmsh4	Normal vegetative growth and development, but moderate to severe reduction in fertility.  Meiosis defective, specifically the presence of numerous univalents at metaphase I and a marked reduction in chiasma frequency.  Early development of meiotic nuclei appears normal but synapsis of homologous chromosomes is delayed and may be incomplete.	15489296
4675:AT4G17380	Atrpa1a / Atmsh4	This double mutant has even lower fertility and shorter siliques than atrpa1 mutants. These mutants have a residual chiasmata frequency and distribution comparable to msh4 mutants.	19153602

4688:AT4G18240	atss4-1	Reduction in starch content. starch turnover  along a diurnal cycle was lower in mutant plants than in wild-type plants, with a clear reduction of both synthesis and degradation rates. Starch levels at the beginning of the light period were higher in the mutant than in the wild-type plants. However, the reduced rate of starch  synthesis in the mutant led to a lower starch level at the end of the illuminated period.	17217470

4696:AT4G18480	aci5-3	Does not accumulate protoporphyrin IX in the presence of acifluorfen whilst wildtype accumulates up to three times more than in the absence of the herbicide.	15815918
4697:AT4G18480	aci5-3	More than 80% of the mutants could grow in the presence of 500nM of the PPOX inhibitor, acifluorfen, while 50% and 100% of wildtype seedlings failed to grown on plates containing 50 and 100nM, respectively.	15815918
4698:AT4G18480	aci5-3	The rate of 5-aminolevulinate (ALA) is one-third of that seen in wildtype, most likely reflecting feedback inhibition.	15815918
4699:AT4G18480	aci5-3	When grown on soil or Kvitko medium, the homozygous line dies at the cotyledon stage. On medium supplemented with sucrose, the same mutant develops to the flowering stage.	15815918

4709:AT4G18770	SALK_020263	Specifically affects female gametophyte while overall morphology of the mutant plants was normal. The cell wall of synergid cells in mutant plants lacked extensive invaginations characteristic of the filiform apparatus. Instead, an extremely thickened cell wall was observed. In most cases, synergid cells lacked cell wall projections completely and had uniform electron density. Also, pollen tube guidance is affected in mutant female gametophytes. In wild-type pollen (and myb98 mutant pollen), pollen tubes grew from the placenta to the funiculus but failed to grow into the micropyle. Despite, fertilization is not affected in mutant plant, female gametophytes affected by the myb98-1 mutation can become fertilized and give rise to seeds. Thus, with the exception of pollen tube guidance, the synergid cells appear to function normally in myb98-1 female gametophytes.	16214903

4714:AT4G18780	irx8 irx1	The homozygous double mutants progeny were severely dwarfed and sterile. The leaves were dark green, indicating an increase in chloroplasts per leaf area of the mutants, which was probably due to the reduced cell size. Several double mutant plants were unable to bolt and only grew rosette leaves.	17237350
4715:AT4G18780	irx8 irx1	The homozygous mutant progeny are severely  deformed and are smaller in size compared with the wild type, possibly reflecting a reduction in water transporting ability.	17237350

4717:AT4G18780	lew2-1	Grown under normal conditions mutant plants show weaker or no wilting phenotype.  Mutant leaves become wilty after plants are transferred from normal conditions to higher transpiration conditions for 6 hrs, whereas wt plants did not show the leaf-wilting phenotype under the same conditions.  Mutants are more resistant to drought and to osmotic stresss in both germination and growth.  Transcription of stress-inducible marker genes (RD29A, P5CS and ABA2) during non-stress  conditions is induced in mutant plants.	15998313

5020:AT4G32551	lug-1 rbe-3	Additive phenotype. The number of second-whorl organs was reduced in lug-1 rbe-3 double mutants and these remaining organs were primarily staminoid. Thus, rbe-3 enhanced the second-whorl phenotype of lug-1 mutants. The double mutant rarely produced any seeds, suggesting a more severe defect in female fertility in the double mutant compared with either single mutant. However, no enhancement of the outer integument growth defect was observed.	16412084
5021:AT4G32551	lug-16/luh-1	Double homozygote are difficult to recover and may die very early in embryogenesis. Plants that do form are reduced in size with mature plants as small as single leaves. The inflorescence bears few flowers consisting of only carpels.	18390806

5037:AT4G32770	npq1 vte1	Molecules produced during oxidative stress (MDA) accumulate in vte1 npq1 leaves after 7 d in high light, confirming the occurrence of lipid peroxidation. Also, fatty acids and chlorophylls levels decrease in npq1 vte1 leaves.
5040:AT4G32770	npq1 vte1	PSII is strongly photoinhibited and lipid peroxidation is enhanced in the double mutant.
5043:AT4G32770	npq1 vte1	Very sensitive to high light stress. When exposed to high light at low temperature,most of the mature leaves of npq1 vte1 bleached in contrast with wild-type, npq1, or vte1 leaves, which did not exhibit visual symptoms of oxidative stress.	16258032
5044:AT4G32770	vte1	In mutant leaves, PSII photoinhibition is more pronounced, and PSII recovery proceeded at a slower rate relative to wild-type leaves. Lipid peroxidation is not detected by TL measurements either in wild-type leaves or mutant leaves. Determination of chlorophyll, fatty acid, and MDA confirmed that tocopherol deficiency in mutant leaves does not increase oxidative stress during long-term exposure of plants to high light stress at low temperature.
5047:AT4G32770	vte1	Mutant is completely devoid of all  four forms of tocopherol.	12213958

The axillary buds, which are typically delayed in growth in wild-type plants, grow out to produce leaves and inflorescences.  The mutant plants have smaller rosette diameters due to a decrease in the lengths of petioles and leaf blades compared with wild-type plants.	16507088
5053:AT4G32810	max4-5	The branching phenotype is more pronounced when plants are grown on short days owing to the nearly tenfold increase in inflorescence number in the mutant versus wild-type plants.	16507088

5055:AT4G32810	max4-6	Mutant shows a significant decrease in petiole length and is highly branched. The axillary buds, which are typically delayed in growth in wild-type plants, grow out to produce leaves and inflorescences.  The mutant plants have smaller rosette diameters due to a decrease in the lengths of petioles and leaf blades compared with wild-type plants.	16507088
5056:AT4G32810	max4-6	No significant change in IAA or ABA levels.	16507088
5057:AT4G32810	max4-6	The branching phenotype is more pronounced when plants are grown on short days owing to the nearly tenfold increase in inflorescence number in the mutant versus wild-type plants.	16507088
5058:AT4G32980	ath1-1	Under LD conditions, the flowering time of ath1-1 is  indistinguishable from that of wild-type Col-8. In  contrast, under SD conditions, ath1-1 plants flower with  approximately 20% fewer leaves than wild-type controls.

5068:AT4G32980	ath1-1/bum1-1	Double mutant enhances the SAM phenotype. 80% of double mutants show shoot termination after germination and production of the first two sets of leaves. Shoots regenerate at a low frequency.	19175771
5069:AT4G32980	ath1-1/pny-40126	Shoot apex arrests prematurely in less than 50% of double mutants. This occurs around 2 weeks post germination or after 8 or so sets of leaves are made. The meristems are reduced in size. After growth resumption new, abnormally shaped leaves are produced and the plants eventually flower.	19175771
5070:AT4G32980	ath1-1/pny-40126/pnf-96116	In triple mutants the primary apical meristem terminates after germination-usually being consumed in the formation of a single terminal leaf. Growth can resume with the formation of new meristems however the phyllotaxy is abnormal.	19175771

5078:AT4G33010	Atgldp1-1 Atgldp2-2	When germinated on MS medium in a CO2 concentration close to 1% in combination with moderate light intensity. Under these conditions, which very strongly suppress 2-phosphoglycolate synthesis by Rubisco, several very small plants with whitish leaves and a growth arrest at the cotyledon stage segregated. Shadowing by leaves of neighbouring plants resulted in minor chlorophyll biosynthesis, but growth was not significantly improved.	17496108

5080:AT4G33430	bak1-2	Same phenotype as bak1-1.	12150929
5081:AT4G33430	bak1-4	Infection of Col-0 plants with PtoDC3000 resulted in lesions that were restricted to  infection sites, whereas infection of mutant lines produced leaf chlorosis followed by spreading necrosis 4 days after infection.

5241:AT4G37650	CS2972	Reduction of the width of  the stele measured at 100 &mu;m above the QC (where the early  differentiation of the phloem and the xylem starts in wildtype)  and reduction of the number of stele cell files visible on  median optical sections in the same region.
5244:AT4G37650	CS2972	Significant reduction in the number of stele initials  in 4-d-old shr-2 seedlings compared to wild-type plants.
5247:AT4G37650	CS2972	The shr-2 mutation strongly perturbs the specification of the  stele initials as well as the patterning of the stele tissues, and  notably the phloem and procambium tissues.
5250:AT4G37750	ant-4 rbe-3	Double mutants had an increased number of sepals compared with either single mutant. In early arising flowers as many as eight sepals were present. In addition, fusion between sepals was observed in ant-4 rbe-3 mutants. Sepals in the double mutant were often fused along their entire length rather than just at their base as usually seen in rbe-3.
5253:AT4G37750	ant-4 rbe-3	Mutant flowers also show a reduction in the overall number of second-whorl organs. In addition, fewer filaments and staminoid organs were present in the double mutant compared with rbe-3 single mutants. Reduced stamen number in the third whorl of ant-4 mutants was partially rescued by rbe-3.	16412084

5260:AT4G37930	shmt1-1	forms chlorotic lesions shortly after  germination which spread as the plant grow and is most prominent between leaf veins. The intensity of the chlorosis and the affected leaf surface increases during maturation until HR-like necrotic spots appear inside the  chlorotic area. shmt1-1 plants also display a reduction in size and rate of development  compared with wild-type controls.	15659103

5267:AT4G38600	kak elc	The double mutant exhibits an additive trichome phenotype. The cluster frequency and number of nuclei was similar to that in elc single mutants and the number of branches was similar to that in kak single mutants.
5270:AT4G38630	rpn10-1 (C24)	The rpn10-1 mutant has elevated levels of ubiquitin conjugates but the RPN(1-186):ARP(exon2):NPTII protein is still detected in a 26S proteasome-enriched fraction. This mutant has a reduced germination rate, several growth abnormalities, increased rosette leaf senescence, a reduction in stamen number, increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, decreased sensitivity to cytokinin, and increased sensitivity to abscisic acid, sucrose, and salt.	12671091
5271:AT4G38630	rpn10-1 (Col)	The rpn10-1 mutant has defects in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis via the 26S proteasome, rendering it more sensitive to misfolded proteins that are degraded in a 26S-proteasome / Ub-dependent manner. However, it has increased levels of the 20S core particle of the proteasome, and exhibits reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress, presumably since oxidatively damaged proteins can be degraded in a 20S proteasome-dependent, but 26S proteasome /Ub-independent manner. The mutation confers the same phenotypes in Col that were described in the C24 background.	17971041
5272:AT4G39080	vha-a2 vha-a3	No tonoplast V-ATPase activity. Severely reduced rosette size. pH shifted to pH 6.4 in double mutants from 5.9 in WT. Reduced leaf growth under short- and long-day conditions is accompanied by varying  degrees of leaf tip and flower necrosis. Calcium content in leaf extracts of vha-a2 vha-a3 plants grown in soil under LD conditions was >2-fold lower than  in WT plants. In the presence of increasing  external concentrations of NaCl neither growth inhibition nor accumulation of sodium, potassium, and chloride was significantly different from WT.

Yellowing leaves in the ggt1-2 mutant was caused by oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation levels increased
5300:AT4G39640	ggt1-1	This mutant plant has reduced levels of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activity, with the magnitude of reduction differing between organs. GGT is reduced by about 90% in leaves and flowers. These mutants are significantly smaller than wild-type plants and have higher levels of chlorosis.	17316175
5301:AT4G39640	ggt1-1 / ggt4-1 / oxp1-1	The 5-oxoproline (5OP) level in this mutant is not significantly different from the level in the oxp1-1 mutant, suggesting that neither GGT1 nor GGT4 are important upstream enzymes for generating the 5OP used by OXP1.	18768907
5302:AT4G39640	ggt1-1 / oxp1-1	The 5-oxoproline (5OP) level in this mutant is not significantly different from the level in the oxp1-1 mutant, suggesting that GGT1 is not an important upstream enzyme for generating the 5OP used by OXP1.	18768907

5309:AT4G39950	cyp79B2 cyp79B3 (AKF)	Subtle growth phenotypes under normal culture conditions: double mutant plants have slightly shorter petioles and smaller leaves, which would be expected if the double mutant produces less IAA.	12464638

5363:AT5G01747	mir164abc	Plants appear normal during vegetative growth. Phenotypic alterations start after the switch to reproductive development. Flowers have an increased number of sepals and petals. Floral organ numbers are highly variable. Individual organs varied in size. Carpels failed to fuse resulting in severe reduction of fertility. In addition, plants display a highly unequal and distorted arrangement of flowers, both with respect to the angle formed by two consecutive flowers and their distance from each other along the axis of the stem.	17287247
5364:AT5G01770	SALK_007632	Under non-limiting conditions of light, water, and mineral nutrition, the growth and development of these plants is unaffected when compared to wild-type Col8 plnats.  No signs of seed abortion are detected in the siliques of heterozygous or homozygous plants.	15607746

5372:AT5G02030	ath1-1/pny-40126	Shoot apex arrests prematurely in less than 50% of double mutants. This occurs around 2 weeks post germination or after 8 or so sets of leaves are made. The meristems are reduced in size. After growth resumption new, abnormally shaped leaves are produced and the plants eventually flower.	19175771
5373:AT5G02030	ath1-1/pny-40126/pnf-96116	In triple mutants the primary apical meristem terminates after germination-usually being consumed in the formation of a single terminal leaf. Growth can resume with the formation of new meristems however the phyllotaxy is abnormal.	19175771

5382:AT5G02030	pnf-33879 pny-40126	Plants do not flower and continue to produce leaves even after 200 days in long-day inductive conditions. Shoot meristems initiated only leaves.  SAMs respond to floral inductive signals but fail to induce floral meristem identity genes. Phyllotaxy in both reproductive and vegetative meristems is altered so that two organs are produced per node vs. the usual one.	15120075
5383:AT5G02030	pnf-96116/pny-40126	Shoot apical meristem terminates prematurely.	19175771

5386:AT5G02030	rpl-2	Inflorescence was shorter in stature than the wild-type inflorescence. In addition, two to three more paraclades developed in this mutant than in wild-type plants.	12897247
5387:AT5G02030	rpl-2	Repla exhibit stripes of narrow cells very  similar to those of the valve margin.	17592013
5388:AT5G02030	rpl-2	The paraclades had a highly penetrant defect that affected the first one or two internodes. These internodes were dramatically reduced in length, giving the appearance of leaves initiating in the axils of the cauline leaves. The internodes on the main stem between the paraclades also often were reduced in size.	12897247
5389:AT5G02030	rpl-2	The pedicels of flowers in pny were slightly shorter than those found in the wild type. Finally, flowers occasionally were aberrant, producing small, curved, club-shaped siliques at a low penetrance	12897247
5390:AT5G02030	rpl-2	Vegetative development appeared normal in pny plants.
5393:AT5G02030	rpl-2	Whereas the internode length was relatively constant in wild-type plants, whereas close examination of the inflorescence in pny showed that internodes between the siliques often were absent or reduced severely. This internode defect appears to be random, because normal-sized internodes were interspersed along the stem. Clusters of siliques often were visible on the  inflorescences stems, indicating that the internode defect could span a large region of the shoot.
5396:AT5G02190	pcs1	Around one-third of the ovules from pcs1/+ plants showed abnormal morphology at the stage of flower opening which then turned brown and degenerated a few days post-pollination. Around 10 to 15% of developing seeds from a self-pollinated pcs1/+ plant were homozygous for the mutant allele, and all pcs1/pcs1 seeds were aborted at early stages. In developing embryos, there was no obvious differences between wt and pcs1 embryos before the heart stage. At the torpedo stage, however, pcs1 embryos underwent degeneration. Degenerated cells were apoptotic, which indicates that the pcs1 mutation causes excessive cell death of embryonic tissues.	15723040

5434:AT5G03280	ein2-5	Following <i>Pythium irregulare</i> infection, salicylic acid levels increased over wild-type levels.	17513501
5435:AT5G03280	ein2-5	In the presence of 150 mM NaCl, the leaves of ein2-5 plants started bleaching after 4 days of treatment. The leaf growth of the ein2-5 plants was dramatically inhibited by 400 mM mannitol although remained green, the wild-type plants, by contrast, stayed green and continued to grow.
5443:AT5G03280	ein2-5	Seedling growth, including cotyledon greening and expansion, was more sensitive to osmotic stress conditions. Severe inhibition in seedling growth was observed when NaCl and mannitol concentrations were 150 mM and 400 mM or higher, respectively. The cotyledons of the germinated ein2-5 seedlings did not expand and were yellow in the presence of 150 mM NaCl and 400 mM mannitol by 10 days after stratification under light.
5446:AT5G03280	ein2-5	Significantly increased susceptibility to the oomycete <i>Pythium irregulare</i>.	17513501
5447:AT5G03280	ein2-5	The germination of mutant seeds was markedly  inhibited by both salt (NaCl) and osmotic stress (mannitol). The inhibition  of germination of the mutant was observed at as low a concentration as 50 mM NaCl, at which concentration the wild-type seeds hardly showed any inhibition in germination.  As the concentrations of NaCl in the media increased, the negative effect of the mutation became more evident. On the high salt medium (greater than or equal to 150 mM NaCl), germination of ein2-5 mutant seeds was inhibited to a greater extent than the wild-type seeds. Likewise, in the medium containing mannitol, the ein2-5 mutant seeds showed similar kinetics in germination. Within a four-day  period, ein2-5 seeds had more than a 30% reduction in germination in the presence of 500 mM mannitol.	17533512

5477:AT5G04040	SDP1-1	The mutant is severely impaired in its ability to breakdown storage lipid. It has a much slower rate of postgerminative growth which can be rescued by providing sucrose to the mutant. In germinating seedlings, triacylglycerol content in the mutant only declined 20% of that in the wild type and clusters of oil bodies are seen in the mutant at this stage of development.	16473965
5478:AT5G04240	SALK_074694C	elf6-3 mutant seedlings do not have any obvious aberrant phenotypes under light-grown conditions, but they do have an early flowering phenotype. Adult plants have reduced cell elongation, manifested in a ~30% reduction in leaf petiole length, but their leaf width is similar to wild-type.

5527:AT5G05780	ae3-1	Produces abaxialized leaves.	17028202
5528:AT5G05850	pirl1-2 pirl9-2	microspore lethal	20697737
5529:AT5G06070	CS6395	Altered petal morphology. A wild-type flower has four petals of almost the same size and shape. A petal is flat from top to bottom, and the bottom part is narrow and greenish. In rbe-1, petals were deformed and their degree of morphological abnormality varied from a mild phenotype of a reduced blade at the top, an intermediate phenotype of spoon-shaped petals with a small blade and a short filamentous stalk at the base, to a severe phenotype of filaments only. In some cases, no petals or filaments were observed at the position of petal formation.
5532:AT5G06070	CS6395	The epidermal cells on the lower surface of the filaments of rbe-1 had an irregular ridged structure similar to that of the lower surface of the wild type, but the cells were flattened and elliptic. The position of the filamentous petals was normal; that is, they were formed in the second whorl at a position between the medial and lateral sepals. Furthermore, in the small or spoon-shaped petals of rbe-1, the epidermal cells had a ridged structure and were smaller . This suggests that the position and identity of the aberrant-shaped petals of rbe was not altered.
5535:AT5G06070	CS6396	Defective in petal development; petals are transformed to filamentous organs, or lost; ovules have shorter integuments than those of wild type, producing shorter siliques; reduced fertility; strong allele.	14681191
5536:AT5G06070	CS6939	Defective in sepal, petal, and ovule development; flowers sometimes produce more than four sepals and exhibit fusion between adjacent sepals; petals are often reduced in size or altered  in appearance, petals often absent or replaced by staminoid organs and filaments; altered integument growth in ovules; reduced fertility.	16412084
5537:AT5G06070	CS6939	During stage 3 of flower development, four sepal primordia are initiated in normal positions in rbe-3 mutants. However, early in stage 4 some rbe-3 sepal primordia have undergone extra growth along their margins and appear wider than normal. The tips of these primordia were sometimes not located in the middle of the primordia and the two sides of the primordia were not symmetrical. Continued uneven growth of these primordia became more pronounced during development. By stage 5, an organ that had presumably initiated as a single primordium now appeared as two fused primordia or two closely spaced and partially fused primordia.
5540:AT5G06070	CS6939	In rbe-3 flowers, second-whorl petals are often reduced in size or altered in appearance. Petals with staminoid characteristics, stamens, filaments or the absence of organs can all be found in the second whorl of rbe-3 mutants.	16412084
5541:AT5G06070	CS6939	Mutant flowers sometimes produce more than four sepals and exhibit fusion between adjacent sepals. More than four sepals were observed in approximately 7% of rbe-3 flowers, while some degree of sepal fusion was observed in 35% of flowers (corresponding to 10% of all sepals). In rbe-3 flowers with more than four sepals, the extra sepal was thinner than the remaining four sepals. In some cases, one of the adjacent sepals was  also somewhat reduced in width. Sepal fusion can occur in the absence of more than four sepals. Sepal fusion was observed most often at the base of these organs and more rarely along their entire length. We measured the width of mature sepals to determine whether  sepal fusion might be due to wider organs. rbe-3 sepals were 12% wider than Landsberg erecta (Ler) sepals at maturity.	16412084
5542:AT5G06070	ag-1 rbe-3	Same phenotype as ag-1 single mutants with completely normal petals developing in the second whorl. In addition, sepal number was normal in these flowers and no cases of sepal fusion were observed.	16412084
5543:AT5G06070	ant-4 rbe-3	Double mutants had an increased number of sepals compared with either single mutant. In early arising flowers as many as eight sepals were present. In addition, fusion between sepals was observed in ant-4 rbe-3 mutants. Sepals in the double mutant were often fused along their entire length rather than just at their base as usually seen in rbe-3.
5546:AT5G06070	ant-4 rbe-3	Mutant flowers also show a reduction in the overall number of second-whorl organs. In addition, fewer filaments and staminoid organs were present in the double mutant compared with rbe-3 single mutants. Reduced stamen number in the third whorl of ant-4 mutants was partially rescued by rbe-3.	16412084
5547:AT5G06070	ap2-1 rbe-3	Additive phenotype in the first and fourth whorls. Second-whorl organs of the double mutant were more completely converted to stamens or were missing entirely.
5550:AT5G06070	ap2-1 rbe-3	The enhancement of the second-whorl phenotypes in these double mutants resulted from AG misexpression.	16412084
5551:AT5G06070	ap2-2 rbe3	In the double mutants, first-whorl carpels and staminoid carpels were often wider than in ap2-2. These organs had the appearance of several fused organs but were only connected to the base of the flower in the central part of the organ and were in a position normally occupied by a single organ. In addition, first-whorl organs were often fused along much of their length. All of the first-whorl organs were sometimes fused such that the fourth whorl carpel poked through a ring of tissue. Cells present along the margin of fusion resembled the epidermal cells normally present on the abaxial replum of wild-type carpels.
5554:AT5G06070	ap2-2 rbe3	The number of first whorl organs in the double mutant was slightly increased compared with ap2-2 single mutants. No second-whorl organs were present in the double mutant and the third and fourth whorls had an additive phenotype.	16412084
5555:AT5G06070	clf-2 rbe-3	The enhancement of the second-whorl phenotypes in these double mutants resulted from AG misexpression.	16412084
5556:AT5G06070	clf-2 rbe-3	leaf curling similar to that in clf-2. Both clf-2 and clf-2 rbe-3 produced an average of 4.0 second-whorl organs per flower. In clf-2 mutants these were almost exclusively small petals whereas the average number of small petals in clf-2 rbe-3 was 1.37. Second-whorl petals were most often replaced by spoonshaped petals, staminoid petals, petaloid stamens or stamens.
5559:AT5G06070	cuc2-1 rbe-3	Four distinct sepal primordia are initiated in a normal pattern during stage 3 of flower development as was seen previously for cuc2-1 and rbe-3 single mutants. Later growth of sepal primordia in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double is uneven, similar to that seen in rbe-3 single mutants. An increased extent of sepal fusion in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double mutant as compared with cuc2-1 was first observed during stage 6.	16412084
5560:AT5G06070	cuc2-1 rbe-3	In double mutant flowers, sepal fusion occurred more often and to a greater extent than in either single mutant.
5563:AT5G06070	lug-1 rbe-3	Additive phenotype. The number of second-whorl organs was reduced in lug-1 rbe-3 double mutants and these remaining organs were primarily staminoid. Thus, rbe-3 enhanced the second-whorl phenotype of lug-1 mutants. The double mutant rarely produced any seeds, suggesting a more severe defect in female fertility in the double mutant compared with either single mutant. However, no enhancement of the outer integument growth defect was observed.	16412084
5564:AT5G06070	ufo-11 rbe-3	Double-mutant flowers have a phenotype that is similar to ufo-11 flowers.	16412084
5565:AT5G06070	ufo-2 rbe-3	Double mutant has the same phenotype as the ufo-2 single mutant. There is no increase in the number of filaments and/or staminoid organs in the double mutant as compared with ufo-2.	16412084

5806:AT5G15800	sep1 sep2 sep3	All flower organs resemble sepals. The second whorl has four green sepal-like organs (instead of four white petals) which are differentiated of interspersed stomata and the conversion of nearly all of the cells into sepal cells. Sepals replace stamens in the third whorl. The fourth whorl is a reiteration of whorls 1, 2 and 3.	10821278
5807:AT5G15800	sep1 sep2 sep3 sep4	All flower organs are converted to leaf-like organs, most strikingly on their adaxial surface. Abaxial epidermal cells are made up of a mixture of leaf- and sepal-like characteristics. Leaf characteristics include an abundance of branched trichomes.	15530395

5819:AT5G16560	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	About nine-tenths of the mutants exhibited abaxialized vasculature. The exclusively adaxialized vasculature observed in kan1 kan2 petioles was not detected in bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 petioles. The radialized portion of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves showed various kinds of organ polarity defects. The vascular bundles of nearly half of the leaves (44.0%) consisted of phloem surrounded by xylem, while one-third (36.0%) displayed xylem surrounded by phloem, and a small percentage (16.0%) had a mixture of both types of vasculature.
5822:AT5G16560	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	Quadruple mutant plants developed narrow leaves with ectopic blade outgrowth along the petioles, like bop1 bop2 leaves, as well as ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina, like kan1 kan2 leaves. However, all of the bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 leaves also showed extended, radialized petiole development that was not observed in either parental genotype.
5825:AT5G16560	bop1-4 bop2-11 kan1-2 kan2-1	bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems had a decreased ratio of adaxialized vascular phenotypes compared with kan1 kan2 stems. Similar to what was observed in petioles, 6.7% of bop1 bop2 kan1 kan2 stems exhibited an abaxialized phenotype of xylem surrounded by phloem, while others (13.3%) had both types of vasculature in a single stem.	17601823
5826:AT5G16560	crc-1 kan1-2	Ectopic adaxial tissues are restricted to the medial domain of the carpels, normally occupied by the abaxial replum.  Formation of external ovule-bearing placentae.	11525739
5827:AT5G16560	kan1 kan2 ats	Similar to kan1 kan2 double mutant.  However, the ovules have a novel phenotype, forming a single amorphous structure in place of both integuments.	16623911
5828:AT5G16560	kan1-2	A few external ovules develop at the base of the gynoecium and straps of ectopic style from along the abaxial replum. Phenotype is present primarily in the first formed carpels.	11525739
5829:AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	All kan1 kan2 stem vascular bundles displayed phloem surrounded by xylem, indicating adaxialized polarity.	17601823
5830:AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	Cotyledons are narrow, cup-shaped and point upward. Leaves are narrow, dark green and develop ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial side only.  Four to six stipules, rather than two, develop at the base of each leaf, surrounding its entire circumference.  Stems fail to elongate upon flowering.  Floral organ morphology is highly abnormal.  Mature ovules have reduced outer integuments. Aberrant positioning of cell types, primarily along the adaxial/abaxial lateral organ axis.	11525739
5831:AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	Double mutant plants have narrow leaves and developed ectopic outgrowths on their abaxial lamina.
5834:AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	External structures of the carpel are largely absent.  Ovules arise from a surface or column of tissue at the center of the flower. The inner integuments of these ovules are normal but the asymmetrical outer integument is now a nearly symmetrical and relatively amorphous collar of tissue.	16623911
5835:AT5G16560	kan1-2 kan2-1	The vasculature in more than half (55.9%) of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles exhibited a pattern of phloem surrounded by xylem, representing an adaxialized phenotype. However, very surprisingly, 17.6% of kan1 kan2 leaf petioles had abaxialized vasculature or a mixture of adaxialized and abaxialized vasculature.	17601823
5836:AT5G16750	toz	Embryo proper is unable to execute regulated divisions in reference to the choice of division plane and the timeing of the division, particularly longitudinal divisions of the plane of the apical-basal axis.	17616738
5837:AT5G16750	toz	Homozygotes are embryo lethal, due to the abortion of toz/toz seeds.  Transmission of the mutation is not affected through the pollen, only through the ovules.  Homozygote embryos also show abnormal expression of patterning genes such as STM, MP, FIL and ANT.	17616738
5839:AT5G16850	SALK_041265C	AtTERT deficiency leads to telomere shortening and absence of telomerase activity.	21865176
5840:AT5G16850	SALK_050921	AtTERT deficiency leads to telomere shortening and absence of telomerase activity.	21865176
5841:AT5G16850	atm / tert	During five generations of growth, both tert and atm/tert lose about 500 bp of chromosome length per generation. But, whereas tert mutants show no visible growth defects through the G6 generation, atm/tert mutants in G5 show severe growth defects, such as aberrant leaf shape, delayed flowering, a loss of apical dominance, and reduced fertility. atm/tert mutants in G5 have a much higher rate of bridged chromosomes than G5 tert mutants.	16166376
5842:AT5G16850	atm / tert	atm tert mutants undergo Telomere Rapid Deletion (TRD) events, that can lead to the production of a chromosome with a very short telomere. Just one of these structures can  prompt end-to-end chromosomal fusion events in the G5 generation. The anaphase bridges apparent in these atm/tert mutants seem to involve only a single chromosome in each distinct mutant line, and seem to occur between sister chromatids. These plants exhibit the same overall level of aneuploidy in the G5 generation as tert mutants do in the G6 generation (~52% of cells showing abnormal centromeric signals in interphase). atm/tert mutants are not as likely to undergo ALT (alternative lengthening of telomeres, a telomerase-independent process) as tert mutants, implicating ATM in this process.	17989233
5843:AT5G16850	atr / tert	atr/tert mutants show a more rapid loss of telomeric length than tert and atm/tert mutants, and show a more rapid degeneration in growth habit, becoming small, with aberrant leaf shape, and very low fertility by the third generation whereas tert mutants and tert/atm mutants show normal growth features until later generations. These mutants also have marked defects in chromosomal organization by G3 as evidenced by the presence of anaphase bridges, sometimes involving multiple chromosomes, a phenotype not seen in tert or atm/tert mutants.	16166376
5844:AT5G16850	ku70 tert	In contrast to the ku70 mutant, which undergo telomerase-dependent expansion to more than twice the normal length in a single generation, the ku70 tert double mutant displays accelerated telomere shortening and a precocious onset of genome stability.
5847:AT5G16850	pot1-1 ku70 tert	Same degree of telomere shortening as in the pot1 ku70 and ku70 tert double mutants.	17627276
5848:AT5G16850	pot1-1 tert	Telomeres in the double mutants shortened at the same rate as in either single mutant.
5851:AT5G16850	pot1-1 tert	Telomeres of the same length and sharp banding profile were found in the double mutant, as in their tert and pot1-1 siblings.	17627276
5852:AT5G16850	tert	50% of the mitotic nuclei in anaphase from tert mutants with severe growth defects (in the G8 generation) have anaphase bridges, while none are found in comparable wild type controls. These anaphase bridges occur disproportionately often between rDNA regions. A number of chromosomal defects can also be visualized during metaphase in these mutants. About 30% of the leaf mesophyll cells examined in tert G8 mutants have elevated numbers of nucleoli.	14579127
5853:AT5G16850	tert	No obvious phenotypic changes in the first (G1) or second (G2) generation. However, starting in G1, the telomeric smear in AtTERT-deficient plants was replaced by several sharp bands. By G2 at least 11 discrete telomeric fragments were visible.
5856:AT5G16850	tert-2	tert-2 mutants in the G4 generation exhibit shorter chromosomes, but also form more massive calluses, indicative of an accelerated cell cycle. These calluses also die more quickly than calluses from wild type plants.	17448460
5857:AT5G17020	xpo1b-1(het)/xpo1a-3(homo)	embryo lethal.	18791220
5858:AT5G17020	xpo1b-1(homo)/xpo1a-3(het)	Female gametophytes do not complete all mitotic divisions and embryo sac development is defective.	18791220
5859:AT5G17220	tt19	brown seed coat, however reduced level of flavonoids in the tapetum cells. Unlike the wild type where flavonoids are accumulated in the tapetosomes in the tapetum cells, the mutant has flavonoids accumulated in the cytosol	17307923
5860:AT5G17290	SAIL_129_B07	early senescence; accumulation of high levels of reactive oxygen species.	19773385
5861:AT5G17290	atg5-1	The T-DNA insertion prevents accumulation of the ATG5 mRNA in the mutants. Absence of 50-kD and a 40-kD proteins, which correspond to the sizes of the conjugate ATG12-ATG5 and the ATG5 proteins, respectively. Homozygous atg5-1 seedlings germinated and developed normally, and flowered and set seed at the same rate as wild-type plants under a long-day photoperiod (16h light/8h dark). Under a short-day photoperiod (8h light/16h dark), the atg5-1 plants grew slower resulting in smaller plants, flowered later than wild type with reduced fecundity, and showed enhanced senescence of rosette leaves. Hypersensitive to N-deficient growth conditions (mutants presented enhanced chlorosis of the cotyledons and reduced true leaf formation). Low recovery rates (20%) after restoration of N in the media, as compared to 100% recovery rates in wildtype. Hypersensitive to carbon starvation induced by darkness (plants become severely chlorotic and flaccid faster and protein loss was higher than in wild type). In C-starved plants the protein levels of ATG7 decreased and the ATG5 increased in the mutant, whereas the protein levels of ATG8 did not drop, but the ATG8 mRNA level increased, unlike in wild type.	16040659
5862:AT5G17310	atugp1/atugp2	The atugp1/atugp2 double mutant showed extremely reduced plant growth and a delayed flowering time.	20435647

5866:AT5G17520	mex1-1	mex1-1 plants are smaller than wild type plants and have severely reduced chlorophyll levels. Maltose levels in the mutants are 40 times above levels found in wild type seedlings. Starch levels are higher in the mutant plants, and they have reduced rates of starch degradation and biosynthesis despite the similar levels of starch metabolic enzyme activity measured in the mutant plants.	14704427
5867:AT5G17520	mex1-2	Maltose levels are reported to be at least 40 times higher in mex1-2 mutants than in wild type plants.	14704427

5873:AT5G17770	cbr1-1	The proportion of 18:3 in the seed oil is decreased in mutant and there is a concomitant increase in the proportion of 18:1 compared with wild type.
5876:AT5G17770	cbr1-1 (FAH12)	A decrease in 18:3 content was observed in the mutant seeds, but it is much less than the decrease in 18:1-OH + 18:2-OH.
5879:AT5G17770	cbr1-1 (FAH12)	No detectable differences from wild type in  growth, development or seed set.	17227547

5881:AT5G17890	chs3-1	When mutant plants are grown at 16C they displayed pleiotrophic developmental defects including dwarfism, small curly leaves and accelerated senescence of the cotyledons. Leaf pavement cells also have abnormal morphology. When grown on plates, chs3-1 plants display an increased freezing tolerance. Plants exhibit chlorosis and spontaneous lesion phenotypes also. These plants also exhibit increased resistance to Psuedomonas syringae.	20444230
5884:AT5G18660	pcb2	plae-green phenotype. Growth rate severely reduced compared to wild-type. The thylakoid membranes are arranged in a disorderly fashion and do not develop distinct grana stacks; extensive adhesion of two to a few thylakoid membranes is observed instead. No distinct differences in the size and the number of chloroplasts between wild-type and mutant. Starch granules are not found in the mutant chloroplasts suggesting a reduction of photosynthetic activity.	15695432

6066:AT5G22000	SALK_023787C	The rhf2a mutant does not have any visibly aberrant phenotypes, but, an rhf1a rhf2a double mutant reveals the role of these two proteins in gametogenesis and protein degradation.	18552199
6067:AT5G22000	rhf1a rhf2a	This double mutant has shorter siliques than WT plants, and lower fertility. Approximately 60% of ovules abort the megagametophytic development process at the FG1 stage. Often, one of the megaspores that is supposed to degenerate remains visible in the rhf1a rhf2a megagametophyte for a prolonged period of time. Some of the mutants arrested at the two nucleate (F2) stage, whereas about 30% developed normal female gametophytes that could be successfully fertilized to produce viable seed. The pollen of the double mutant is largely defective with about 50-70% nonviability compared to ~0.5% nonviability for wild type pollen. The pollen for rhf1a rhf2a mutants appears to develop normally through PMI, but 30-40% of the pollen grain fail to undergo this mitotic division, and then, of those that did pass through, another 20-30% never go through the next round of cell division (PMII). The variety of different ploidy levels measured in generative cells arrested at the PMII phase indicate that they could be blocked at the G1, S, or G2. Levels of myc:KRP6 increase in the double mutant, suggesting that this protein is a putative substrate of this E3 ubiquitin ligase. And many of the aberrant phenotypes observed in the double mutant can be improved when KRP6 levels are decreased by RNAi.	18552199

Earlier senescence of cotyladons and mature leaves. Pale green and smaller seeds. Delay in embryo maturation. Reduced fertility.	17189343
6086:AT5G23080	tgh-1	Adult homozygous tgh mutant plants have a reduced stature and significantly smaller lanceolate leaves. Anthers failed to elongate and produce pollen. Almost complete infertility. At the seedling stage, tgh mutant seedlings are recognizable by developmental defects, including triple cotyledons, altered cotyledon shape, and reduced elongation growth in dark-grown seedlings. The triple cotyledon phenotype is,  however, not fully penetrant (e.g., only 7 of 362 progeny seedlings of a TGH/tgh-1 parent line displayed the triple cotyledon phenotype corresponding to a penetrance of 7.7%). tgh mutants have an imperfect vascular system  with differentiated but frequently unconnected vascular strands, which is cuased by a defect in the initiation of vascular development.	16024589

6108:AT5G23230	nic2-1	Under moist-chilled (stratified) conditions, mutant seeds showed  a slightly retarded germination,  but there was no difference in the final percentage germination. However, in the absence of a moist  chilling pre-treatment (non-stratified), germination was delayed  and the germination potential of mutatn seeds was  significantly lower than that of Ws, indicating a  hyperdormant phenotype.
6111:AT5G23235	nic2-1	A twofold decrease in  nicotinamidase activity was seen in dry seed extracts of the mutant.
6114:AT5G23235	nic2-1	Freshly harvested nic2-1 seeds had a decreased  level of poly(ADP)ribosylation compared to Ws seeds.
6117:AT5G23235	nic2-1	Mutant plants appeared  to grow and develop normally. Their seeds  phenotype have paler seed coat colour compared  to wild-type Ws but the embryo was the same colour as WT.
6120:AT5G23235	nic2-1	Mutant seeds show  hypersensitivity to nicotinamide (inhibitor of seed germination).
6123:AT5G23235	nic2-1	Significant 1.75-fold increase of NAD levels.	17587307
6124:AT5G23235	nic2-1	Treatment with  1 mM NADH promoted a small but significant increase in  germination of mutant seeds.
6127:AT5G23235	nic2-1	Under moist-chilled (stratified) conditions, mutant seeds showed  a slightly retarded germination,  but there was no difference in the final percentage germination. However, in the absence of a moist  chilling pre-treatment (non-stratified), germination was delayed  and the germination potential of mutatn seeds was  significantly lower than that of Ws, indicating a  hyperdormant phenotype.
6130:AT5G23260	tt16-6	Altered seed pigmentation pattern due to a lack of proanthocyanidin (PA) accumulation in the endothelium.  The inner cell layer of the inner integument showed an abnormal cell shape.  The endothelial layer may be absent or the identity of this cell layer is changed.	16925602

6152:AT5G23630	mia-1	Mutant plants exhibit a severe reduction in fertility and markedly reduced size of the siliques. Mutant microspores fail to separate from tetrads and pollen grains are fragile with an abnormal morphology and altered cell wall structure. Consequently, pollen grain was mostly not released from open anthers, and those that were released, appeared as pollen tetrads. Pollen germination in vitro was very poor, compared to the wild type pollen. In addition, mutant plants suffer from imbalances in cation homeostasis.	16291648

6154:AT5G23670	Atlcb2a-1 Atlcb2b-1	Double mutant is male gametophytic lethal due to defects in pollen development. Phenotype of the double mutant pollens became apparent in the bicellular stage. The cytoplasm was less dense and plastids were dilated and lacked oil droplets. The nuclear envelope structure was modified by the formation of vesicles between the inner and outer membranes. The microspores lacked the intine layer, and consequently lacked clearly defined ER and Golgi.	18208516

6174:AT5G24360	GK-638B07	bZIP60 mRNA splicing is detectable in ire1b-1 (GABI_638B07), whereas it is completely abolished in ire1a-2 (SALK_018112)/ire1b-1 (GABI_638B07) double mutant.	
6175:AT5G24360	ire1-1	IRE1-1 transcript levels appear to be the same in ire1-1/IRE1-1 heterozygous and IRE1-1 homozygous (i.e. wild-type) plants. However, when heterozygotes are selfed, no ire1-1 homozygous mutants are recovered.	18574595
6176:AT5G24360	ire1a-2/ire1b-1	bZIP60 mRNA splicing is completely abolished in ire1a-2 (SALK_018112)/ire1b-1 (GABI_638B07) double mutant whereas it is still detectable in ire1a-2 and ire1b-1 single mutants. ire1a-2/ire1b-1 double mutant is much more sensitive to tunicamycin than wild-type and ire1a-2 and ire1b-1 single mutant plants.  Induction of a number of ER stress-inducible genes is much weaker in the ire1a-2/ire1b-1 double mutant than in the wild-type.	
6177:AT5G24380	SALK_001348	Morphology and development of mutant plants grown in soil or in standard culture conditions was unaltered. When grown under iron deficiency, mutant plants were comparable to wild type control. The same was observed when plants were grown under zinc, copper and manganese deficiency. The metal content (measured by ICP-MS) was indistinguishable from those present in the wild type plants.	15255869
6179:AT5G24520	urm23 gl1-2	urm23 enhances the hypomorphic gl1-2 allele and results in almost complete glabrousness (loss of trichomes) in normal growth condition. urm23 gl1-2 double mutant does not increase trichomes at all in response to wounding or methyl jasmonate treatment. urm23 is dominant in gl1-2 background. gl1-2 is incompletely dominant in urm23 background.	19234066
6181:AT5G25350	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	Double mutants exhibits a clearly detectable delay in bolting time: plants had still not bolted by ~25 days after the mean bolting time of WT in LDs.	17389366
6182:AT5G25350	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	GA treatment did not restore a normal growth phenotype or floral transition to double mutant plants grown in SDs.
6185:AT5G25350	ebf1-1 ebf2-1	The double mutant is still responsive to ethylene. Moreover, inhibitors of ethylene perception or biosynthesis including AgNO3 and aminoethoxyvinyl glycine (AVG) could not suppress the constitutive triple response (ctr1).	14675533
6190:AT5G25350	ebf1-3 ebf2-3	Strong growth arrest following germination even in the absence of ethylene. Plants fail to develop true leaves.	17307926
6192:AT5G25350	ebf1-3 ebf2-3 ein3-1	More dramatic rescue of the ebf1-3 ebf2-3 phenotype. Seedlings grow rapidly after germination and eventually developed large rosette of true leaves. However the leaves are epinastic with elongated petioles and small leaf blades. Produced fertile but shorter flowers and viable seeds.	17307926
6193:AT5G25350	ebf1-3 ebf2-3 ein3-1 eil1-3	Almost complete rescue of the ebf1-3 ebf2-3 phenotype. Plants are phenotypically indistinguishable from the wild type.	17307926

6195:AT5G25350	ebf2-1	The mutants were indistinguishable from wild-type under normal growth conditions. However, when germinated in the dark, all three mutant alleles showed a slightly exaggerated response to ACC. Nevertheless, striking developmental alterations resembling those of the ctr1 mutants were observed.	14675533
6196:AT5G25380	cyca2;1-1	Ploidy levels show an increased ratio of 32C cells compared to the wild type in dark-grown hypocotyls and an increase in levels of 16C cells in light-grown hypocotyl and cotyledon cells.	17012601

6216:AT5G26920	GK-075G12	cbp60g-2 plants are more susceptible to infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola ES4326.  Salicylic acid levels are lower in cbp60g-2 than in wild-type following treatment with flg22 peptide or challenge with P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 hrcC.	19214217
6217:AT5G26920	SALK_023199C	cbp60g-1 plants are more susceptible to infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola ES4326.  The expression profile of plants challenged with P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 hrcC is altered.  Salicylic acid levels are lower in cbp60g-1 than in wild-type following treatment with flg22 peptide, challenge with P. syringae pv tomato DC3000 hrcC, or infection with P. syringae pv. maculicola ES4326 (only at an early time point).  CBP60g binds calmodulin, and calmodulin-binding is necessary for complementation of cbp60g-1 pathogen growth and salicylate defects. These phenotypes were interpreted as indicating a defect in activation of salicylate synthesis during a MAMP/PAMP (microbe/pathogen- associated molecular pattern) response.	19214217
6218:AT5G27150	nhx1	Reduced monovalent cation-dependent proton transport activity.  Vacuoles isolated from leaves had a much lower Na+/H+ exchange activity.  Altered leaf development, with a reduction in the frequency of large epidermal cells and a reduction in overally leaf area compared to wt plants.	14535887

6244:AT5G27320	gid1c-2	Phenotype not described.	17194763
6245:AT5G27807	eep1	Flowers have more petals than the wild-type, particularly in the first 10 flowers.  Four petal primordia are initiated in the same positions as in wild-type.  The extra petals, if initiated, always arise adjacent to these normally positioned petals.  Occasionally, petals form incisions at their distal tip and adopt a heart shape.  There is also a subtle carpel fusion defect at the distal end of the gynoecium in a small portion of mutant flowers.  The organ-number defect is petal specific.  In mutant plants, the transcript levels of the transcription factors CUC1 and CUC2 are significantly increased compared to wild-type.  Overall expression domains of CUC1 and CUC2 appear to be normal.  However, during floral stages 5-7, extra CUC1- and CUC2-expressing cells are observed in the second whorl.	15723790
6246:AT5G27807	mir164abc	Plants appear normal during vegetative growth. Phenotypic alterations start after the switch to reproductive development. Flowers have an increased number of sepals and petals. Floral organ numbers are highly variable. Individual organs varied in size. Carpels failed to fuse resulting in severe reduction of fertility. In addition, plants display a highly unequal and distorted arrangement of flowers, both with respect to the angle formed by two consecutive flowers and their distance from each other along the axis of the stem.	17287247
6247:AT5G28490	lsh1-D	Plants exhibit shorter hypocotyls and larger cotyledons under continuous white, red, blue, and far-red light.  They also have shorter rosette petioles compared to wild type. Hypocotyl cells in the mutant plants are shorter than those of wild type plants.	14871309

6262:AT5G33340	CDR1-D	Dwarf phenotype.	14765119
6263:AT5G33340	CDR1-D	Increased resistance to the virulent Pseudomonas  syringae (both pathovars: tomato and maculicola), demonstrated by an absence of macroscopic lesions upon infection. Small lesions comprising one or a few dead cells persist in the mutant.	14765119
6264:AT5G35220	SALK_134931	Dual phenotype, reduced chlorophyll content and gravicurvature-defective. Significant increase in anthocyanin content, abnormal chloroplasts, reduced photosynthetic capacity. Severely reduced lamellae lipid membranes in the plastids. The mutant plants have retarded growth phenotypes. The plastids of the mutant line had fewer stromal thylakoids, no grana, less starch grains and more densely stained, globular structures that likely represent plastoglobuli. Moreover, the resultant defects in chloroplast integrity undoubtedly lead to a dramatic decrease in the photosynthetic capacity, which consequently results in smaller plants and lower seed number. At the same time, abnormal chloroplasts and reduced photosynthetic capacity may create a nutritional stress response, which is marked by a significant increase in the anthocyanin levels. This finding is consistent with the observations that anthocyanins are induced by a number of environmental stresses.	15659096
6265:AT5G35220	egy1-2	Suppresses elongation and gravicurviture in light grown hypocotyls.	18097640
6267:AT5G35520	SALK_012070C	No defects in kinetochore assembly are detected in this mutant, but it does grow more slowly than wild type plants at elevated temperatures (25-30 degrees C).	16331414
6268:AT5G35520	mis12-1	No homozygous mutants could be recovered in selfed seed suggesting that loss of MIS12 causes embryo lethality.	16331414
6269:AT5G35700	fim5-1	fim5 mutant exhibits delayed pollen germination and retarded pollen tube growth. FIM5 loss-of-function leads to redistribution of actin cytoskeleton in pollen grains and disorganization of actin filaments in pollen tubes.	21098731
6270:AT5G35700	fim5-2	fim5 mutant exhibits delayed pollen germination and retarded pollen tube growth. FIM5 loss-of-function leads to redistribution of actin cytoskeleton in pollen grains and disorganization of actin filaments in pollen tubes.	21098731

6273:AT5G35750	ahk2-1cu ahk3-1cu	Bolting time is slightly delayed (2 to 3 days) and the inflorescence stem length is reduced. However, morphology and fertility of the flowers is relatively unaffected.	15155880
6274:AT5G35750	ahk2-1cu ahk3-1cu	Compact rosettes with shortened petioles and small leaf blades.	15155880

6278:AT5G35750	ahk2-1cu ahk3-1cu	The hypocotyl length of the double mutant is slightly decreased; this effect is largely due to reduction in cell number rather than cell size.	15155880

But, this mutant is not more susceptible to the virulent necrotrophic pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris or to the avirulent necrotrophic pathogen Alternaria brassicicola. There is no significant difference in the glucosinolate or camalexin content of MeJA-treated ptr3-1 and wild type plants.

In response to salt-stress, the mutant appears to produce wild-type levels of proline. However, unlike wild type seedlings, mutant seedlings cannot survive when arginine or ornithine is provided as the sole nitrogen source, implicating this enzyme in arginine catabolism.	18419821

6520:AT5G46290	SAIL_503_E03	Mutant kasI plants have multiple morphological defects, including chlorotic (in netted patches) and curly leaves, reduced fertility, and semidwarfism. There are only one to five enlarged chloroplasts in the mesophyll cells of chlorotic sectors of young kasI rosette leaves, indicating suppressed chloroplast division under KASI deficiency. KASI deficiency results in a significant change in the polar lipid composition, disrupted embryo development before the globular stage and dramatically reduces FA levels (~33.6% of the wild type) in seeds.	21081696
6522:AT5G46330	fls2-17	The mutant exhibits a significant flg22-induced reduction in bacterial growth, indicating that the gene is most probably not required for flg22-induced bacterial resistance.	15085136

6527:AT5G46700	stm-1 trn2-23010	30 from a total of 40 seedlings (75%) developed at least one leaf 8 days after germination and all double mutant progeny developed leaves by day 20. In 19 stm-1 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings, leaves initiated from the base of the cotyledons, which were always fused due to lack of early STM activity. In the remaining 21 double mutant progeny single leaves or side shoots arose laterally, from the outside of the fused base of the petioles instead of being initiated from the shoot apex and thus resembled stm-1 mutant side shoots which are initiated after a long delay.	17351828
6528:AT5G46700	stm-1 trn2-23010	The double mutant progeny does not develop flowers.	17351828
6529:AT5G46700	stm-5 trn2-23010	About 51% of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutant seedlings produced leaves by 8 days after germination, compared to only 3% in the stm-5 single mutant. In contrast to combination with stm-1, leaves of stm-5 trn2-23010 double mutants never initiated from outside the base of the cotyledon petioles but emerged internally to the cotyledons where the SAM normally resides in wild type.
6532:AT5G46700	stm-5 trn2-23010	The double mutant progeny does not develop flowers.	17351828
6533:AT5G46700	trn1-2 trn2-4	No obvious phenotype different from those of trn1-2 or trn2-4 was observed in double mutant.	16531491
6534:AT5G46700	trn2-2	Enlarged apical dome, altered in shape  and often protruding (the mutant meristem therefore contains over 40% more cells.)	17351828
6535:AT5G46700	trn2-2	Phenotypic differences from wild type development first became evident with the emergence of the first true leaves. All leaves were severely twisted and irregularly shaped and many lacked large parts of the leaf lamina. This twisting phenotype was not restricted to the vegetative phase but involved cauline leaves, the inflorescence stem and all floral whorls.
6538:AT5G46700	trn2-2	The architecture of mutant flowers was distorted and was accompanied by reduced numbers of floral organs in the outer 3 whorls. This effect was least pronounced in the whorl of sepals (3.2 as against 4 in wild type) but the number of petals was reduced to 2.4 (4 in wild type) and on average, mutant flowers had only 3.5 stamens compared to 6 in wild type. In contrast, all mutant flowers contained 2 carpels such as in wild type but in 52% of mutant flowers, both carpels remained unfused and ovules were exposed.
6541:AT5G46700	trn2-2	Unfused carpels did not form siliques later during development. In contrast, the remaining flowers with fused carpels developed siliques which were twisted and failed to fully elongate.  However, these siliques produced no fertile seeds and reciprocal crosses with wild type plants revealed nonfunctionality of both male and female reproductive organs.	17351828
6542:AT5G46700	trn2-23010 clv3-2	trn2-23010 clv3-2 double mutant flowers also exhibited an additive phenotype not observed in single clv3-2 or trn2-23010 plants: double mutant flowers had reduced organ numbers in sepal, petal and stamen whorls, reminiscent of trn2-23010 single mutant flowers and in contrast to clv3-2 single mutant flowers, there was no increase in the number of stamens. However, in the fourth whorl, where trn2 loss-of-function interferes with the fusion of two carpels to the single style, double mutant flowers were comprised of multiple carpels, most of them fused (73%) as typically found in the clv3-2 mutation. Supernumerary stem cells in clv3-2 mutant floral meristems therefore not only led to the initiation of multiple carpels in the trn2 background but also favoured their fusion to a single style which remained severely twisted. In addition to a style consisting of multiple carpels, over-proliferating callus-type tissue was observed at the tip of the style in all flowers.
6545:AT5G46700	trn2-23010 wus-1	Whereas carpels were completely absent in wus-1 flowers and only 1.6 stamens (compared to 6 in wild type) developed in the third floral whorl, all trn2-23010 wus-1 flowers developed 2 carpels, which in contrast to trn2-23010 single mutants were seldom open (33%) and more usually fused. Consistent with the increased number of stamens (4.2 on average) in the third floral whorl, the trn2 mutation may compensate for a premature consumption of stem cells in wus-1 flowers. In contrast, the number of sepals and petals in the outer perianth whorls in trn2-23010 wus-1 was closer in number to that of the trn2 mutant rather than to wus-1 single mutant flowers.
6548:AT5G46830	atnig1-1	atnig1-1 plants show reduced survival rate, fresh weight,  chlorophyll content, and protein content under salt stress.
6551:AT5G46860	SALK_075924	The morphology of mutant plants was similar and to some extend weaker than ssm plants. Ectopic occurrence of myrosin cells is found in the leaves (increased number of myrosin cells). Mutant plants accumulated abnormally abundant levels of TGG1 and TGG2, both enzymatically active proteins.	16306062
6553:AT5G46860	ssm	Semi-dwarf and wavy leaf phenotype, due to the elongation of the stem internodes and leaves. Initially, mutant seedlings were indistinguishable from wild-type under continuous light conditions, but as they grow the mutant plants develop short rosette leaves with severely wavy leaf blades. Mutant plants begin flowering several days later than wild-type plants during the reproductive stages of growth. They also display more rosette leaves than wild-type plants and show reduced growth of the inflorescence stems. The height of the mature ssm plants measures approximately one-quarter of that of the wild type. In contrast to these distinct phenotypes, however, the morphology of the flower organs and the fertility levels are unaffected in ssm plants. Histological analyses revealed that the length of the epidermal cells in the inflorescence stems of ssm plants was shorter that wild type but that the ssm mutation has little or no effect on the lengths of the pith parenchyma cells. Furthermore, the length of the parenchyma cells around the midribs of the rosette leaf petioles is clearly reduced in ssm mutants, whereas the mesophyll cell size in the rosette leaf blades is unaffected.	15937323

In addition, seed germination in  the mutant also showed increased sensitivity to inhibition by osmotic stress conditions produced by high concentrations of  salt and mannitol. Further analyses indicated that increased stress sensitivity in the mutant may be a result of both ABA  hypersensitivity and increased accumulation of ABA under the stress conditions.

6610:AT5G49020	atprmt4a-2 atprmt4b-1	These double mutants have delayed flowering compared to wild type plants when grown under long day conditions. Analysis of growth under short day conditions indicates that these mutants are not disrupted in the photoperiod pathway. These double mutants also seem to be able to respond to vernalization signals and to gibberellin. But they have an impaired autonomous pathway to flowering. FLC transcripts are up-regulated in these double mutants through an unknown mechanism. The global level of asymmetric dimethylation of arginine 17 in histone 3 (H3)is reduced in these mutants. The transcript levels for several repressors of FLC do not seem to be altered in the double mutants, nor are there discernible changes in several types of H3 modifications at the FLC locus.	18660432

6635:AT5G50210	old5	The old5 mutant has almost a 3-fold reduction in its ability to stimulate the Cys desulfurase activity of Cp NifS. But, the quinolate synthase activity of the old5 mutant is not significantly different from the wild type level of activity, most likely because the QS domain is not the site of the mutation. Aspartate oxidase transcript levels are increased in the old5 mutant. And, NAD, NADH, NADP, and NADPH levels are also increased 27 days after germination. The activity of the NAD salvage pathway appears to be upregulated in this mutant. The level of several other metabolites, including those associated with the TCA cycle, are also altered in old5 mutants. The respiration rate of old5 is elevated compared to the respiration rate in wild type seedlings which leads to an increase in oxidative stress.	18978034

6747:AT5G53950	cuc2-1 cuc3-101	Production of the first pair of leaf primordia is significantly delayed compared to the wild type.  This likely reflects a defect in embryonic shoot meristem initiation.	17122068
6748:AT5G53950	cuc2-1 rbe-3	Four distinct sepal primordia are initiated in a normal pattern during stage 3 of flower development as was seen previously for cuc2-1 and rbe-3 single mutants. Later growth of sepal primordia in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double is uneven, similar to that seen in rbe-3 single mutants. An increased extent of sepal fusion in the cuc2-1 rbe-3 double mutant as compared with cuc2-1 was first observed during stage 6.	16412084
6749:AT5G53950	cuc2-1 rbe-3	In double mutant flowers, sepal fusion occurred more often and to a greater extent than in either single mutant.

6754:AT5G54260	atmre11-3	The mutant showed vegetative growth defects and sterility.
6757:AT5G54270	SALK_036200	The mutant shows ABA insensitivity in stomatal movement, including promotion of stomatal closure and inhibition of stomatal opening. The detached leaves of the mutant lose more water than those of the wild-type plants under dehydration condition; both young seedlings and mature plants of the mutant have lower capacity to conserve water during drought stress in comparison with wild-type plants. The ROS levels increase in the mutant in comparison with wild-type plants in both the whole leaves and in guard cells. Treatment with low concentrations of ABA reduces ROS levels in both whole leaves(1 to 10 uM ABA application) and in guard cells(5 uM ABA application) in the mutant plants.	22143917
6758:AT5G54310	nev-3	floral organ shedding, abnormal (differences in abscission zone morphology were first detected when organ separation normally occurs in wild-type flowers (stage 16). At this point, abscission zone cells expand and become vacuolated in wild type (Fig. 1F), whereas in mutant flowers the organs stay attached and cells within the sepal and petal abscission zones remain small and densely cytoplasmic);    Golgi apparatus, abnormal (in mutant plants, cells in the region of sepal abscission zone predominately exhibited circularized or cup-shaped multilamellar structures rather than the flat stacks of Golgi cisternae typical of wild type);    tubular-vesicular networks, abnormal;    paramural bodies, present in greater numbers in organisms (flowers, fruit walls and pedicels of mutant flowers).	19429787
6760:AT5G54380	the1-1 prc1-1	The hypocotyl growth rate of the double mutant, which was initially slower than that of prc1-1, strongly increased beyond day three to reach over half the growth rate of WT hypocotyls between day four and day five. Beyond day five, the growth rate dropped, but more gradually than that of the WT.
6763:AT5G54380	the1-1 prc1-1	The number of cells in epidermal-cell files was unaltered in the double mutant compared to prc1-1 hypocotyls.
6766:AT5G54380	the1-1 prc1-1	When expressed per seedling, the 14C-glucose incorporation in the cellulosic fraction was reduced 2.5-fold in prc1-1 compared to the WT, and did not differ significantly from that of the1-1/prc1-1 mutants; this confirmed that cellulose biosynthesis was not restored in the double mutant.	17540573

6778:AT5G54650	ath5-1	Endosperm development is defective, cellularization of the endosperm is delayed.	15765105
6779:AT5G54690	irx8 irx1	The homozygous double mutants progeny were severely dwarfed and sterile. The leaves were dark green, indicating an increase in chloroplasts per leaf area of the mutants, which was probably due to the reduced cell size. Several double mutant plants were unable to bolt and only grew rosette leaves.	17237350
6780:AT5G54690	irx8 irx1	The homozygous mutant progeny are severely  deformed and are smaller in size compared with the wild type, possibly reflecting a reduction in water transporting ability.	17237350

[Plant morphology, growth and development]: shorter and rounder leaves; more lobed edges; undulated surface and shorter petioles; changes to the internal structure of the leaf (disorganized vascular bundles, altered cell shape, less defined palisade structure, smaller chloroplasts and thicker leaves); delayed bolting and flowering. [Molecular phenotype]: 1414 genes significantly up-regulated and 1033 down-regulated more than two-fold in alx8 leaf tissue relative to their expression in Col-0 wild type; increased levels of the polyamine putrescine; decreased levels of fructose, galactose, glucose, cellobiose and a large number of unknown sugars and sugar derivatives; accumulation of unknown sugars and sugar derivatives; low levels of organic acids citrate, isocitrate, fumarate and malate; very low starch accumulation; lack of transitory starch granules in chloroplasts.

7029:AT5G64740	rsw1-10 prc1-18	Both mutation are additive, as shown by the further shortened hypocotyl length of the double mutant.	
7031:AT5G64740	the1-1 prc1-1	The hypocotyl growth rate of the double mutant, which was initially slower than that of prc1-1, strongly increased beyond day three to reach over half the growth rate of WT hypocotyls between day four and day five. Beyond day five, the growth rate dropped, but more gradually than that of the WT.
7034:AT5G64740	the1-1 prc1-1	The number of cells in epidermal-cell files was unaltered in the double mutant compared to prc1-1 hypocotyls.
7037:AT5G64740	the1-1 prc1-1	When expressed per seedling, the 14C-glucose incorporation in the cellulosic fraction was reduced 2.5-fold in prc1-1 compared to the WT, and did not differ significantly from that of the1-1/prc1-1 mutants; this confirmed that cellulose biosynthesis was not restored in the double mutant.	17540573

7044:AT5G64813	lip1-1	lip1-1 seedlings are early phase mutants showing a shortened period length in DD and LL (red light) conditions using CCR2:LUC+ and CAB2:LUC reporters. The shortened period length of ~1-2 hours is also observed in assays of rhythmic leaf movements. Dark-grown seedlings subject to temperature entraining still show cycling of the CCR2:LUC+ reporter, but the period length is shorter in lip1-1 mutants than in C24 control seedlings. lip1-1 mutants do not adjust their photoperiods in response to different fluence rates of constant red or blue light, unlike wild type seedlings. They are more sensitive than wild type seedlings to resetting pulses of light during the first portion of subjective night, but their responses are similar during most other portions of the circadian cycle. The period of CCA1:LUC+ and LHY:LUC+ (morning oscillator genes) is shorter under low fluence red light in lip1-1 than in the C24 parent line. Wild type seedlings growing in dim light/dark cycles, have similar levels of morning oscillator (LHY, CCA1) genes as lip1-1, but have higher transcript levels for the TOC1 evening oscillator. Hypocotyl length is reduced in lip1-1 mutant seedlings grown under constant red or blue light at all fluences, but matches wild-type hypocotyl length for seedlings grown in constant FR light or darkness. In all comparative experiments, both the lip-1 mutant and the C24 line referred to as the "wild type" or "parent" line carry the CAB2:LUC reporter.	17683937
7045:AT5G64813	lip1-2	Light/dark-entrained lip1-2 seedlings released into low fluence red light have a shorter period (by ~1.5-2 hours) for both morning (CCA1, LHY) and evening (TOC1) oscillator genes as determined by northern blots.	17683937
7047:AT5G65090	mrh3-1	Straight hairs with ballooned bases	16367956
7048:AT5G65110	SALK_006464	Lipid catabolism during germination and early post-germinative growth was delayed in the acx2-1 mutant, with 3-day-old seedlings accumulating long-chain acyl-CoAs. Mutant plants have reduced medium- and long-chain Acyl-CoA enzyme activity. Seedling growth and establishment in the absence of an exogenous supply of sucrose was unaffected.  Unlike acx1-1 mutants, jasmonic acid accumulation was not reduced upon wounding of mutant plants when compared to the wild type.	16146525
7049:AT5G65110	acx1-1 acx2-1	Double mutant seedlings were unable to catabolize seed storage lipids and accumulated long-chain acyl-CoAs. The acx1-1 acx2-1 seedlings were also unable to establish photosynthetic competency in the absence of an exogenous carbon supply, a phenotype that is shared with a number of other Arabidopsis mutants disrupted in storage lipid breakdown. Germination frequency of the double mutant was significantly reduced compared with wild-type seeds. This was unaffected by the addition of exogenous sucrose, but was improved by dormancy-breaking treatments such as cold stratification and after-ripening.  Peroxisomes in the cotyledons were enlarged in double mutants, while in single mutants (acx1-1 and acx2-1) peroxisomes were identical to the wild type.	16146525

7054:AT5G65700	bam1-1 bam2-1	Anthers in double mutant plants appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective.	16751349

7106:AT5G66750	ros1-1 ddm1-2 (LUC transgene)	The luminescence response of the ros1/ ros1::ddm1/ddm1 double mutant was much higher than that of ros1/ros1::DDM1/DDM1 plants, but was still lower than that of ROS1/ROS1::DDM1/DDM1 plants.	12526807
7107:AT5G66870	asl1	No visible mutant phenotype.	15821980
7108:AT5G66870	dsl1-D	Flowers and siliques bend downwards and pedicels are reduced in length.  The inflorescence is more compact with respect to wild type due to a reduction in internode length.  Overall plant height is approximately half that of a wild type Ws-3 plant. Change in lignin deposition in the mutant.  Deposition begins much earlier in the mutant and an irregular pattern of lignin accumulation results in gaps in the lignin ring.	15821980
7112:AT5G67060	hec1	Shows no alteration in fruit phenotype.	17855426
7113:AT5G67060	hec1	The transmitting tract of hec1 was  indistinguishable from that of wild type in size, staining intensity (Alcian Blue) and cytology.	17855426
7114:AT5G67060	hec1 hec3	Compared with wild type, stigmas were smaller and more variable in size in hec1 hec3 mutants. There was also a slight tendency for the style to be somewhat longer in the double mutant.	17855426
7115:AT5G67060	hec1 hec3	Double mutant had a sizable reduction in overall fertility (17% wild-type seed set), along with significant variations in individual fruit size and seed yield. Seed distribution was biased toward the apical half of the carpel, but substantial fertilization also occurred in the basal half.	17855426
7116:AT5G67060	hec1 hec3	Mutant carpels showed significantly fewer pollen tubes and pollination events, particularly in the basal half of the gynoecium.	17855426
7117:AT5G67060	hec1 hec3	The double mutant, however, had dramatically reduced Alcian Blue staining in both the style and the septum compared with wild type. In analyzing pre-fertilization stages of development, the transmitting tract of the hec1 hec3 double mutant had no delay in onset of ECM production, but produced less ECM than wild type.	17855426
7118:AT5G67100	icu2-1	Leaf incurvature; early flowering; flowers display partial homeotic transformations of sepals into carpels and of petals into stamens.	17873092
7119:AT5G67160	eps1-1	Enhanced susceptibility to both virulent and non-virulent strains of Pseudomonas.	19036031
7121:AT5G67330	atnramp3 atnramp4	No visible phenotype when grown on regular soil in greenhouse. On agar medium under low Fe supply, germination was arrested during first four days. This phenotype was transient, since seedlings recovered and cotyledons regained green color. When grown on calcareous soil, double mutant seedlings did not green and appeared bleached after 6 days, and very few seedlings survived beyond seedling stage, with early lethality over 90% (in Fe restrictive alkaline soil conditions).	16270029
7122:AT5G67330	atnramp4-1	No obvious phenotype, when grown on soil in the greenhouse or in vitro on a solid medium with complete nutrients. In addition, no obvious difference in the level of chlorosis was observed under Fe starvation between mutant plants and wild type.	16270029
